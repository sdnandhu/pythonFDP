## COURSE OBJECTIVES
	To develop an understanding of algorithmic problem solving
	To read and write simple Python programs.
	To develop Python programs with conditionals and loops.
	To define Python functions and call them.
	To use Python data structures –- lists, tuples, dictionaries.
	To do input/output with files in Python.
 
### UNIT I  ALGORITHMIC PROBLEM SOLVING                                                                    9
 Algorithms, building blocks of algorithms (instructions/statements, state, control flow, functions), notation (pseudo code, flow chart, programming language), algorithmic problem solving, simple strategies for developing algorithms (iteration, recursion)
 
### UNIT II  DATA, EXPRESSIONS, STATEMENTS                                                                  9
Python interpreter and interactive mode; values and types: int, float, booleans, strings, and lists; variables, expressions,  statements, tuple assignment, precedence of operators, comments; modules and functions, function definition and use, flow of execution, parameters and arguments;  **Illustrative programs**: exchange the values of two variables, circulate the values of n variables, test for leap year.
 
### UNIT III CONTROL FLOW, FUNCTIONS                                                                               9
Conditionals: Boolean values and operators, conditional (if), alternative (if-else), chained conditional (if-elif-else); Iteration: state, while, for, break, continue, pass; Fruitful functions: return values, parameters, scope: local and global, composition, recursion; Strings:  string slices, immutability, string functions and methods, string module; Lists as arrays. **Illustrative programs**: square root, gcd, exponentiation, sum the array of numbers, linear search, binary search.
 
### UNIT IV  COMPOUND DATA: LISTS, TUPLES, DICTIONARIES                                          9
Lists, list operations, list slices, list methods, list loop, mutability, aliasing, cloning lists, list parameters; Tuples, tuple assignment, tuple as return value; Dictionaries: operations and methods; advanced list processing - list comprehension; **Illustrative programs**: selection sort, insertion sort, merge sort, quick sort.
 
### UNIT V FILES, MODULES, PACKAGES                                                                              9
Files and exception: text files, reading and writing files, format operator, command line arguments,  errors and exceptions, handling exceptions, modules, packages; **Illustrative programs**: word count, copy file,
