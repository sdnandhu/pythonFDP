# FDP Notes - Day 2

**Goal:**

0. https://github.com/kgisl/pythonFDP/blob/master/README.md#outcome-expected -
please sign to indicate your commitment to making this a reality.
	 - Use http://j.mp/whyPython2016 to motivate your students to learn the
language really well

1. Review the entries for Lab1, Lab6, and Lab7.
2. To have a **first draft** of all the solution keys for the Lab exercises by
end of the day.
	- If possible, provide test cases through a CyberDojo session link
(like the one for http://10.100.8.8/kata/edit/3BAD00470A?avatar=hyena ).
	- Come up with Pre-lab and Post-lab questions for each of them.
3. Ask for help in specific areas that you are not familiar with in the Theory
syllabus. Ramya can provide training in those specific areas.
4. Solve the CloudCoder exercises related to the labs - ask for help if you are
not able to solve them. Ramya to provide the list.

**Action Items**
1. Divide up yourself in **pairs** to tackle the Lab Exercises (other than
Lab1, Lab6 and Lab7). Contributions to improve the existing material for Lab1,
Lab6 and Lab7, if any, can be made after the other labs have been completed
2. Ramya will add your submissions as and when they are ready to the repo. It
is preferable to make your contributions in **Markdown**
(https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) to the repository.
However, for the time being, you may provide Word/ASCII versions generated from
whichever editor you are comfortable with.

#### Summary: Problem solving and Programming
- The whole course is about problem solving. What is not mentioned in the
curriculum of the syllabus is a method to teach students using which they can
do problem solving.
- Incremental way of arriving at the solution is _arguably_ the only teachable
and learnable technique for problem solving, most definitely at the fundamental
level. To do this effectively you have to simplify the problem and convey the
simplified solution for the simple problem. And then progressively progress
towards the complete problem and the complete solution. When this is done in a
proper manner,  even the most challenged student will be able to think a little
bit for himself and the most high performing student will have learnt a new
technique, in addition to his capacity to memorize and vomit in the paper.
- Most importantly by adopting this method you are able to engage every student
in your classroom to learn problem solving and programming.
- Whether you are able to use this technique in your classroom or not, you as a
faculty member must be aware of this technique so you adopt it to improve your
own capacity to learn programming, and therefore better equipped to empower
your students with the same.


## The FAC Challenge

The Faculty Algorithmic Challenge:

1. Choose an algorithm of your choice.
    - For inspiration review http://j.mp/htmlFAC
2. Register with Lanitha on what your choice is.
3. Set a deadline for making a presentation on the challenge

	- how it works
	- What is the real-world application of the algorithm
	- Present the material in an engaging manner using <20 slide PPT in no
more than 6 minutes
