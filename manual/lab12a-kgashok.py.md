# Lab 12a: File content sorter 

[TOC]

## Overall Instructions 

1. Update `KyG.id` file with your details
2. Read the instructions file
3. Ask your mentor plenty of questions
4. Modify the basic Python files to solve the problem statement
5. Incorporate whatever exception handling code that would be appropriate. 

## Problem Statement 

### Sort a file of integers

Please read the question carefully - 
most errors are because you did not read the
instructions carefully. Make sure your
program produces the expected output,
and nothing else. Make sure that the
output is in a file called `output.txt`.
Do not use `C:\output.txt` or any other
such path. Similarly, make sure you
read the data from `input.txt` and not
from `C:\input.txt` or anything else. Do
not print anything to stdout. Do not
prompt the user to enter numbers. 

> Write a program which will read
> a bunch of integers from an input

> result to an output file.

You must read the input from `input.txt`
and you must write the output to `output.txt`. 
The input will contain one integer per line, 
and you’re expected to stop reading when 
you reach EOF. The output should also have
one integer per line.

## Warning 
Do not print anything else to 
`output.txt`. Do not print prompts like 
`“Please enter a number.”` The output should 
not contain anything other than the sorted 
integers, one per line.

If your input is something like this: 

```
	3 
	4 
	7 
	1 
	5 
```

The output should be

``` 
	1 
	3 
	4 
	5 
	7

```

## Important Notes
Please write your program in Python. 

You must be able to read the input from a 
file called `input.txt` in the current directory. 
You must be able to read the file in a format 
exactly as shown above - do not assume that any 
other information will be provided in the file 
or on standard input. You must write your output 
to a file called `output.txt` in the current directory. 

Do not write or print anything else into `output.txt`
other than the expected answer. Do print anything extra to
`stdout` or to the output file (if any). 

Read the instructions carefully. Most candidates fail 
because they did not follow the instructions exactly.
