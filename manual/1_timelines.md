## Timelines

As per the Discussion, the road map for the Python subject is defined and presented below for your reference.

Plan of action:

Python FDP          --&gt; 5th  to 8th June 2017.  
                              --&gt; Lab manual preparation  
                              --&gt; Theory material preparation  
Deadlines:

As 7 faculties handling 1st year python classes, so 5 of them can prepare for theory, each one unit.

From IT - Mr. Rajasekar  and Ms. Dhanalakshmi will be preparing material for First Two Units.

Version 1: June 16th

Final Version: 23rd June,2017

Lab manual- Version 1   16th June 2017.

Lab Manual Final Version - 23rd June 2017.

Both Theory and Lab should be discussed among all faculties who handle Python.

Lab Manual could be done based on your mail message.
