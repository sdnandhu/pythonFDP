# Lab 1: Compute the gcd of two numbers 

[TOC]

## Problem statement 

Write a Python program to compute the greatest common divisor (***gcd***) of two positive integers.

	Sample Input1: 17, 17
	Sample Output1: 17
	
	Sample Input2: 0, 17
	Sample Output2: 17

	Sample Input3: 12, 17
	Sample Output3: 1 
		
	Sample Input3: 44, 33
	Sample Output3: 11



## Solution Key

```python 

def gcd(number1, number2):
    while True:
	    if number2 != 0:
	        (number1, number2) = (number2, number1 % number2)
	    else:
		    break
    return number1


def get_twonumbers():
    global a, b  
    a = input('Enter number: ')
    b = input('Enter number: ')
    a, b =  int (a), int (b)


# Program starts here
a = None  # initializing variables
b = None
get_twonumbers() # to get values from user 
gcdval = gcd(a, b) 
print ('The gcd is ', gcdval)

```

## Pre-Lab Questions 

0. Show your manual workings for the ***gcd*** of 924 and 2562. 
1. What is the practical use of calculating the ***`gcd`*** of two numbers? 
2. If you have written the recursive solution of the Euclid algorithm, then write the iterative solution, and vice versa. 
3. How does the algorithm for the `gcd` of two numbers work? What is the name for this algorithm? Why is it so special? 
4. Why is the `global` keyword used in the function `get_twonumbers`? 
5. Is the function `get_twonumbers()` fruitful or not fruitful? 
6. Define a function `is_valid_year` with parameter `year`. The function must return `True` if the value of `year` is between 1900 and 3000 (_inclusive_). Otherwise, it must return `False`. 

## Post-lab Questions

0. What if `a` or/and `b` are negative integers? How will you modify the program to handle this?  Clue: Use the `abs()` function. 

## Bonus 1 
0. How will find the `gcd` of three integers? 
1. How do you calculate the number of days in a month?

```python
def gcd_r(a, b): 
	if b == 0: 
		return a
	return gcd_r(b, a % b)
```

##### Days per month 

```python
def is_valid(mnum):
    return 1 <= mnum <= 12


def is_multiple(n, d):
    return n % d == 0


def is_leap(year):
    """
    Whether a year is a leap year?
    The rules are as follows:
      - multiple of 4 and not of 100 or
      - multiple of 400
    """

    return (is_multiple(year, 4)
            and not is_multiple(year, 100)
            or is_multiple(year, 400))


# Number of days per month (except for February in leap years)
mdays = [0, 31, 28, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31]


def monthdays(year, month):
    if not is_valid(month):
        return -1

    ndays = mdays[month] + (month == 2 and is_leap(year))
    return ndays
