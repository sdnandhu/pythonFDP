## Modified Bubble Sort Approach

* Typically `O(n**2)` and therefore good only for small data sets. 
* Most likely they are **stable** sorts - meaning they maintain the order in which equal elements appear in the list

### Selection Sort

### Insertion Sort

## Divide and Conquer Approach

* Typically `O(n*logn)` and therefore suitably for bigger data sets. 
* As in the case of Merge Sort, it requires additional space \(so for real large sets, this can be a disadvantage\). For Quick Sort, additional `nlog(n)` space is required. 
* Typically,  as in the case of Quick Sort, they are also not **stable** sorts - the order of equal elements may not be maintained after the sort is complete
