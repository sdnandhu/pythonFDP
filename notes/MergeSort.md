        - How to get all the elements to the right of the midpoint of a list and place it in another list? 
        - Write a function `sliceInTwo` which accepts a list as argument. It should returns two lists that contain equal number of elements from the original list.
     - Misc 
         - Provide an example for using the ternary operator in Python
         - What is the most critical thing that is to be specified in a recursive call so that the program does not run forever? 
         - How do you swap two variables in the same statement? 
   
  - Histogram 
	  - Write a sample code snippet which uses list comprehension to create a list of numbers from 1 to 10 
      - Create a list that contains all the keys in a dictionary. What is the code?
      - Create a list that contains all the values in a dictionary. What is the code?
      - Create a list of tuples from a dictionary that contains all the key:value pairs. 
          - Sort the tuples in the list based on its value in descending order
          - Write code for both the above. 
   
# SelectionSort 

## Algorithm

## Source code

```python
def selectsort(a):
  n = len(a) 
  for i in range(n):
    smallest = min(a[i:])
    index_of_smallest=a.index(smallest)
    a[i],a[index_of_smallest]=a[index_of_smallest],a[i]

  return a
```

# InsertionSort 

## Algorithm

## Source code

```python
n=int(input("Enter the size of the list:"))
print("Enter the numbers:")
a=[int(input())for i in range(n)]
print("The list elements are: ",a)
for i in range(n):
    smallest= i 
    for j in range(i+1, len(a)): 
        if a[smallest] > a[j]: 
            smallest = j 
    a[i],a[smallest]=a[smallest],a[i]
print("The sorted list is:",a)
```

# MergeSort

Notice that at each level we divide the array into two halves until we get bunch of single element arrays. This is the divide  portion of the divide and conquer  method. Then, we start merging and sorting the smaller arrays in a series of steps which is the conquer  portion of divide and conquer.

## Merge example 

1. How many lists are there in Row 4? 
2. Until what row is **Divide** happening? 
3. From which row onwards **Conquer** has begun? 

![mergeExample](http://bit.ly/mergeExample2)


- InsertSort and SelectionSort are examples of **comparison** sorts
- However, MergeSort, is an example of the **Divide-and-Conquer** algorithm sorts

  - **Divide** means portioning the n-element array to be sorted into two sub-arrays of n/2 elements. If A is an array containing zero or one element, then it is already sorted. However, if there are more elements in the array, divide A into two sub-arrays, A1 and A2, each containing about half of the elements of A. 
  - **Conquer** means sorting the two sub-arrays recursively using merge sort. Combine means merging the two sorted sub-arrays of size n/2 to produce the sorted array of n elements.

## Algorithm
The basic steps in the recursive MergeSort Algorithm is as follows: 

Func MERGESORT: 
    input (unsorted list of elements)  `ulist` 
    output (sorted list of elements)   `slist`

- TERMINAL CASE: 
	- If size of list is 0 or 1, return (*since it is already sorted*)

- Split the unsorted list (`ulist`) into equal sublists: left sublist and right sublist 
- Recursively call MergeSort on the left sublist (`leftA`) 
- Recursively call MergeSort on the right sublist (`leftB`) 
- Merge the sorted left and sorted right sublists to form one sorted list 
- Return the sorted list (`slist`) 

## MergeSort implementation in Python

Visualize at http://tinyurl.com/visualMerge 

```python
# a helper function for the mergesort function
# function to merge already sorted lists
def merge(A, B): 
  C = []
  while A and B:
    candidate = (A if A[0] < B[0] else B).pop(0)
    C.append(candidate)

  # pick up the residual elements in A or B	
  C += A + B
  return C

def mergesort(ulist): 
  if len(ulist) <= 1: 
    return ulist

  mid = int(len(ulist)/2)

  leftA    = ulist[:mid]
  rightB   = ulist[mid:]

  sortedA  = mergesort(leftA) 
  sortedB  = mergesort(rightB)
	
  slist = merge(sortedA, sortedB)
  return slist

# test cases
assert (merge([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 10]) == [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10])
alist = [6, 2, 1, 5, 8, 7, 4, 3]
print(mergesort(alist))
# [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
```
