# TDD Approach to grokking InsertSort 

## 0 Create a sorted list containing numbers from 0 to 6. 
 - Draw a representation diagram of the list, indicating values and indexes corresponding to the values
 - Take the 3rd element and the last element and multiply them. Write code that does this and prints the actual value of the multiplication.
 - Write a python program to create a list containing numbers 0 through 6. The first 3 elements must be in sorted in ascending order. The last 3 elements must be unsorted. 
	 - example: `[4, 5, 6, 0, 2, 1, 3]`or `[4, 5, 6, 1, 3, 2, 0]`


## 1 Insert the `element  3.5` into the sorted list at index 4
 - Draw a representation diagram of the list, indicating values and indexes corresponding to the values 
 - What is the python code which will achieve this? Print the list before the insertion and print the list after the insertion
 - Try doing the above step using `enumerate` to display the index and value pairs and validate your diagram with it 
## 

## 2 Place the last element `3.5` in an `almost` sorted list into the list at index 4 
 - Build a sorted list containing numbers 0 to 6. Append 3.5 into the list at the very end. 
 - Draw a representation diagram for the above list 
 - Write Python code to remove `3.5` from its current location and then insert it at index 4. Print the list before and after insertion. 

## 3 Place the last element `2.5` in an `almost` sorted list into the list at the appropriate index so it fully sorted 
  - Build a sorted list containing 0 to 6. Append `2.5` into the list at the very end. 
  - In your notebook, write pseudo-code for determining how to find the index at which it needs to be inserted. 
	  - Convert the pseudo code into Python code.  
	  - Print the list before and after your insertion has happened

## 4 Place the 4th element in the list into the first part of the list `[0:3]` at the appropriate location
  - Build a list in this order `[4, 5, 6, 0, 3, 1, 2]` - the 4th element being `0`. Represent this using a diagram in your notebook 
  - Initialize `idx = 4` and iterate through the first part of the list (which is already sorted) and insert it into the array at the appropriate location. Write the code for this. 

## 5 Place the last four elements in the list so that the list is fully sorted 
  - Build a list in this order `[4, 5, 6, 0, 3, 1, 2]`
  - Iterate through the last four elements and perform the same operations you did in the previous exercise
  - Validate through proper print statements that your list is actually properly sorted 

## 6 Place your code inside a function  `insertsort`and write test cases to test the functionality 


## 7 Replace the list method calls and instead use `slicing` to achieve the same sorting operation 


# Notes
1. Bring your code and notes to the FDP session in a notebook of your own. 
2. Use appropriate names for the variables so the code is self-explanatory. Additional comments may also be included to further explain the code 
3. Share with me your code through `repl.it` even prior to coming to class
4. In the same file, clearly mark the code corresponding to the various steps that I have detailed above 
5. Alternatively, you may use CyberDojo to document your progress and write test cases for validation 
	- Use [http://cyberdojo1.kgfsl.com/id_join/show](http://cyberdojo1.kgfsl.com/id_join/show) link and the session ID EUUPUS

## Pre-requisites

1. Familiarity with List methods and operations
	- pop()
	- insert() 
	- slicing

## Activities

1. Use a set of playing cards and demonstrate how they actually know **insert_sort** already
	2. Ask for a video contribution for **mergesort** since there is good one available on the web. Ask them to be creative and make it engaging video, unlike mine below! 
		3. Sample is available at http://j.mp/compareSort 
2. Use repl.it  or pythonanywhere (even better since it comes with Unix shell prompt as well) - form a list containing some random numbers of their choice. 
	3. Use alist.pop() and alist.insert alternatively and manually ask them to sort their own list using the insertsort technique
	4. There is a piece of code that they have to write to reflect what they are doing in their head 
	5. SPOILER ALERT! - http://bit.ly/manInsert

3. Write code on CloudCoder http://j.mp/insertionSortCC
