# FDP for Python

Reason 0

> The basis for education in the last millennium was reading, writing, and arithmetic; now it is reading, writing, and computing. - Sedgwick

Reason 1

> You can code. They cannot. That is pretty damn cool. - [_LTHW Python_](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/advice.html)

Reason 2

> Python is a multipurpose programming language and widely used for Data Science, which is termed as the sexiest job of this century. - [Vinay Babu, DSC](http://www.datasciencecentral.com/profiles/blogs/learn-python-for-data-science-from-scratch)

### Things to Decide

* choice of IDE? [https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) - is it available online?
* CloudCoder problems to go over? 
* CyberDojo sessions? 
* Who wants to focus on RPA? 
  * We now can enroll some faculty to become RPA experts / consultants...both in KGCAS and KITE and they can progress on their own to some level of expertise...and take students along.

### Draft Agenda

1. [http://bit.ly/fizzBuzzVideoCD](http://bit.ly/fizzBuzzVideoCD) for review before workshop
2. Blockly 10-part challenge and Python equivalent code review 
3. CD-1 review of [http://j.mp/fizzBuzzPythonFDP](http://j.mp/fizzBuzzPythonFDP) 
4. Part 2 - OOP version Custom Start - [http://j.mp/oopFizzBuzzCD](http://j.mp/oopFizzBuzzCD)
5. Part 3 - expand CD-2 to output sequence 
6. Part 4 - expand CD-3 to output for FizzBuzzPlus⁠⁠⁠⁠

### Python for Data Science

Read up the write up at [http://j.mp/pythonForDataScience](http://j.mp/pythonForDataScience).

1. [https://developers.google.com/edu/python/](https://developers.google.com/edu/python/) - At Google, all this material makes up an intensive 2-day class, so the videos are organized as the day-1 and day-2 sections.
2. [https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/) 
3. Automate the boring stuff using Python
