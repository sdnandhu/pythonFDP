# HashMap


An implementation of a hashtable using a BetterMap that grows so that the number of items never exceeds the number of LinearMaps.   
The amortized cost of add should be O(1) provided that the implementation of sum in resize is linear. 

## Methods


### __init__


Starts with 2 LinearMaps and 0 items. 

#### Parameters
name | description | default
--- | --- | ---
self |  | 





### get


Looks up the key (k) and returns the corresponding value, or raises KeyError if the key is not found. 

#### Parameters
name | description | default
--- | --- | ---
self |  | 
k |  | 





### add


Resize the map if necessary and adds the new item. 

#### Parameters
name | description | default
--- | --- | ---
self |  | 
k |  | 
v |  | 





### resize


Makes a new map, twice as big, and rehashes the items. 

#### Parameters
name | description | default
--- | --- | ---
self |  |
