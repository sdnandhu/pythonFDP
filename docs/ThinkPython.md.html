<h2 id="the-strange-history-of-this-book">The strange history of this book</h2>
<p>In January 1999 I was preparing to teach an introductory programming class in Java. I had<br>
taught it three times and I was getting frustrated. The failure rate in the class was too high<br>
and, even for students who succeeded, the overall level of achievement was too low.</p>
<p>One of the problems I saw was the books. They were too big, with too much unnecessary<br>
detail about Java, and not enough high-level guidance about how to program. And they all<br>
suffered from the trap door effect: they would start out easy, proceed gradually, and then<br>
somewhere around Chapter 5 the bottom would fall out. The students would get too much<br>
new material, too fast, and I would spend the rest of the semester picking up the pieces.</p>
<p>Two weeks before the first day of classes, I decided to write my own book. My goals were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep it short. It is better for students to read 10 pages than not read 50 pages.</li>
<li>Be careful with vocabulary. I tried to minimize the jargon and define each term at<br>
first use.</li>
<li>Build gradually. To avoid trap doors, I took the most difficult topics and split them<br>
into a series of small steps.</li>
<li>Focus on programming, not the programming language. I included the minimum<br>
useful subset of Java and left out the rest.</li>
</ul>
<p>I needed a title, so on a whim I choseHow to Think Like a Computer Scientist.</p>
<p>My first version was rough, but it worked. Students did the reading, and they understood<br>
enough that I could spend class time on the hard topics, the interesting topics and (most<br>
important) letting the students practice.</p>
<p>I released the book under the GNU Free Documentation License, which allows users to<br>
copy, modify, and distribute the book.</p>
<p>What happened next is the cool part. Jeff Elkner, a high school teacher in Virginia, adopted<br>
my book and translated it into Python. He sent me a copy of his translation, and I had the<br>
unusual experience of learning Python by reading my own book. As Green Tea Press, I<br>
published the first Python version in 2001.</p>
<p>In 2003 I started teaching at Olin College and I got to teach Python for the first time. The<br>
contrast with Java was striking. Students struggled less, learned more, worked on more<br>
interesting projects, and generally had a lot more fun.</p>
<p><strong>vi Chapter 0. Preface</strong></p>
<p>Over the last nine years I continued to develop the book, correcting errors, improving some<br>
of the examples and adding material, especially exercises.</p>
<p>The result is this book, now with the less grandiose titleThink Python. Some of the changes<br>
are:</p>
<ul>
<li>I added a section about debugging at the end of each chapter. These sections present<br>
general techniques for finding and avoiding bugs, and warnings about Python pit-<br>
falls.</li>
<li>I added more exercises, ranging from short tests of understanding to a few substantial<br>
projects. And I wrote solutions for most of them.</li>
<li>I added a series of case studies—longer examples with exercises, solutions, and<br>
discussion. Some are based on Swampy, a suite of Python programs I wrote for<br>
use in my classes. Swampy, code examples, and some solutions are available from<br>
<a href="http://thinkpython.com.">http://thinkpython.com.</a></li>
<li>I expanded the discussion of program development plans and basic design patterns.</li>
<li>I added appendices about debugging, analysis of algorithms, and UML diagrams<br>
with Lumpy.</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope you enjoy working with this book, and that it helps you learn to program and think,<br>
at least a little bit, like a computer scientist.</p>

<h2 id="chapter-1">Chapter 1</h2>
<h1 id="the-way-of-the-program">The way of the program</h1>
<p>The goal of this book is to teach you to think like a computer scientist. This way of think-<br>
ing combines some of the best features of mathematics, engineering, and natural science.<br>
Like mathematicians, computer scientists use formal languages to denote ideas (specifi-<br>
cally computations). Like engineers, they design things, assembling components into sys-<br>
tems and evaluating tradeoffs among alternatives. Like scientists, they observe the behav-<br>
ior of complex systems, form hypotheses, and test predictions.</p>
<p>The single most important skill for a computer scientist is <strong>problem solving</strong>. Problem solv-<br>
ing means the ability to formulate problems, think creatively about solutions, and express<br>
a solution clearly and accurately. As it turns out, the process of learning to program is an<br>
excellent opportunity to practice problem-solving skills. That’s why this chapter is called,<br>
“The way of the program.”</p>
<p>On one level, you will be learning to program, a useful skill by itself. On another level, you<br>
will use programming as a means to an end. As we go along, that end will become clearer.</p>
<h3 id="the-python-programming-language">1.1 The Python programming language</h3>
<p>The programming language you will learn is Python. Python is an example of a <strong>high-level<br>
language</strong> ; other high-level languages you might have heard of are C, C++, Perl, and Java.</p>
<p>There are also <strong>low-level languages</strong> , sometimes referred to as “machine languages” or “as-<br>
sembly languages.” Loosely speaking, computers can only run programs written in low-<br>
level languages. So programs written in a high-level language have to be processed before<br>
they can run. This extra processing takes some time, which is a small disadvantage of<br>
high-level languages.</p>
<p>The advantages are enormous. First, it is much easier to program in a high-level language.<br>
Programs written in a high-level language take less time to write, they are shorter and<br>
easier to read, and they are more likely to be correct. Second, high-level languages are<br>
<strong>portable</strong> , meaning that they can run on different kinds of computers with few or no modi-<br>
fications. Low-level programs can run on only one kind of computer and have to be rewrit-<br>
ten to run on another.</p>

<p>Figure 1.2: A compiler translates source code into object code, which is run by a hardware<br>
executor.</p>
<p>Due to these advantages, almost all programs are written in high-level languages. Low-<br>
level languages are used only for a few specialized applications.</p>
<p>Two kinds of programs process high-level languages into low-level languages: <strong>interpreters</strong><br>
and <strong>compilers</strong>. An interpreter reads a high-level program and executes it, meaning that it<br>
does what the program says. It processes the program a little at a time, alternately reading<br>
lines and performing computations. Figure 1.1 shows the structure of an interpreter.</p>
<p>A compiler reads the program and translates it completely before the program starts run-<br>
ning. In this context, the high-level program is called the <strong>source code</strong> , and the translated<br>
program is called the <strong>object code</strong> or the <strong>executable</strong>. Once a program is compiled, you<br>
can execute it repeatedly without further translation. Figure 1.2 shows the structure of a<br>
compiler.</p>
<p>Python is considered an interpreted language because Python programs are executed by an<br>
interpreter. There are two ways to use the interpreter: <strong>interactive mode</strong> and <strong>script mode</strong>.<br>
In interactive mode, you type Python programs and the interpreter displays the result:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>1 + 1<br>
2</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The chevron,&gt;&gt;&gt;, is the <strong>prompt</strong> the interpreter uses to indicate that it is ready. If you type<br>
1 + 1, the interpreter replies 2.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can store code in a file and use the interpreter to execute the contents of<br>
the file, which is called a <strong>script</strong>. By convention, Python scripts have names that end with<br>
.py.</p>
<p>To execute the script, you have to tell the interpreter the name of the file. If you have a<br>
script nameddinsdale.pyand you are working in a UNIX command window, you type<br>
python <a href="http://dinsdale.py">dinsdale.py</a>. In other development environments, the details of executing scripts<br>
are different. You can find instructions for your environment at the Python websitehttp:<br>
<a href="//python.org">//python.org</a>.</p>
<p>Working in interactive mode is convenient for testing small pieces of code because you can<br>
type and execute them immediately. But for anything more than a few lines, you should<br>
save your code as a script so you can modify and execute it in the future.</p>
<p><strong>1.2. What is a program? 3</strong></p>
<h3 id="what-is-a-program">1.2 What is a program?</h3>
<p>A <strong>program</strong> is a sequence of instructions that specifies how to perform a computation. The<br>
computation might be something mathematical, such as solving a system of equations or<br>
finding the roots of a polynomial, but it can also be a symbolic computation, such as search-<br>
ing and replacing text in a document or (strangely enough) compiling a program.</p>
<p>The details look different in different languages, but a few basic instructions appear in just<br>
about every language:</p>
<p><strong>input:</strong> Get data from the keyboard, a file, or some other device.</p>
<p><strong>output:</strong> Display data on the screen or send data to a file or other device.</p>
<p><strong>math:</strong> Perform basic mathematical operations like addition and multiplication.</p>
<p><strong>conditional execution:</strong> Check for certain conditions and execute the appropriate code.</p>
<p><strong>repetition:</strong> Perform some action repeatedly, usually with some variation.</p>
<p>Believe it or not, that’s pretty much all there is to it. Every program you’ve ever used,<br>
no matter how complicated, is made up of instructions that look pretty much like these.<br>
So you can think of programming as the process of breaking a large, complex task into<br>
smaller and smaller subtasks until the subtasks are simple enough to be performed with<br>
one of these basic instructions.</p>
<p>That may be a little vague, but we will come back to this topic when we talk about <strong>algo-<br>
rithms</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-debugging">1.3 What is debugging?</h3>
<p>Programming is error-prone. For whimsical reasons, programming errors are called <strong>bugs</strong><br>
and the process of tracking them down is called <strong>debugging</strong>.</p>
<p>Three kinds of errors can occur in a program: syntax errors, runtime errors, and semantic<br>
errors. It is useful to distinguish between them in order to track them down more quickly.</p>
<p><strong>1.3.1 Syntax errors</strong></p>
<p>Python can only execute a program if the syntax is correct; otherwise, the interpreter dis-<br>
plays an error message. <strong>Syntax</strong> refers to the structure of a program and the rules about that<br>
structure. For example, parentheses have to come in matching pairs, so(1 + 2)is legal,<br>
but8)is a <strong>syntax error</strong>.</p>
<p>In English, readers can tolerate most syntax errors, which is why we can read the poetry<br>
of e. e. cummings without spewing error messages. Python is not so forgiving. If there<br>
is a single syntax error anywhere in your program, Python will display an error message<br>
and quit, and you will not be able to run your program. During the first few weeks of your<br>
programming career, you will probably spend a lot of time tracking down syntax errors.<br>
As you gain experience, you will make fewer errors and find them faster.</p>
<p><strong>4 Chapter 1. The way of the program</strong></p>
<p><strong>1.3.2 Runtime errors</strong></p>
<p>The second type of error is a runtime error, so called because the error does not appear until<br>
after the program has started running. These errors are also called <strong>exceptions</strong> because they<br>
usually indicate that something exceptional (and bad) has happened.</p>
<p>Runtime errors are rare in the simple programs you will see in the first few chapters, so it<br>
might be a while before you encounter one.</p>
<p><strong>1.3.3 Semantic errors</strong></p>
<p>The third type of error is the <strong>semantic error</strong>. If there is a semantic error in your program, it<br>
will run successfully in the sense that the computer will not generate any error messages,<br>
but it will not do the right thing. It will do something else. Specifically, it will do what you<br>
told it to do.</p>
<p>The problem is that the program you wrote is not the program you wanted to write. The<br>
meaning of the program (its semantics) is wrong. Identifying semantic errors can be tricky<br>
because it requires you to work backward by looking at the output of the program and<br>
trying to figure out what it is doing.</p>
<p><strong>1.3.4 Experimental debugging</strong></p>
<p>One of the most important skills you will acquire is debugging. Although it can be frus-<br>
trating, debugging is one of the most intellectually rich, challenging, and interesting parts<br>
of programming.</p>
<p>In some ways, debugging is like detective work. You are confronted with clues, and you<br>
have to infer the processes and events that led to the results you see.</p>
<p>Debugging is also like an experimental science. Once you have an idea about what is going<br>
wrong, you modify your program and try again. If your hypothesis was correct, then you<br>
can predict the result of the modification, and you take a step closer to a working program.<br>
If your hypothesis was wrong, you have to come up with a new one. As Sherlock Holmes<br>
pointed out, “When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however im-<br>
probable, must be the truth.” (A. Conan Doyle,The Sign of Four)</p>
<p>For some people, programming and debugging are the same thing. That is, programming<br>
is the process of gradually debugging a program until it does what you want. The idea is<br>
that you should start with a program that doessomethingand make small modifications,<br>
debugging them as you go, so that you always have a working program.</p>
<p>For example, Linux is an operating system that contains thousands of lines of code, but<br>
it started out as a simple program Linus Torvalds used to explore the Intel 80386 chip.<br>
According to Larry Greenfield, “One of Linus’s earlier projects was a program that would<br>
switch between printing AAAA and BBBB. This later evolved to Linux.” (The Linux Users’<br>
GuideBeta Version 1).</p>
<p>Later chapters will make more suggestions about debugging and other programming prac-<br>
tices.</p>
<p><strong>1.4. Formal and natural languages 5</strong></p>
<h3 id="formal-and-natural-languages">1.4 Formal and natural languages</h3>
<p><strong>Natural languages</strong> are the languages people speak, such as English, Spanish, and French.<br>
They were not designed by people (although people try to impose some order on them);<br>
they evolved naturally.</p>
<p><strong>Formal languages</strong> are languages that are designed by people for specific applications. For<br>
example, the notation that mathematicians use is a formal language that is particularly<br>
good at denoting relationships among numbers and symbols. Chemists use a formal lan-<br>
guage to represent the chemical structure of molecules. And most importantly:</p>
<pre><code>Programming languages are formal languages that have been designed to
express computations.
</code></pre>
<p>Formal languages tend to have strict rules about syntax. For example, 3+ 3 = 6 is a<br>
syntactically correct mathematical statement, but 3+ =3$6 is not. H 2 Ois a syntactically<br>
correct chemical formula, but 2 Zzis not.</p>
<p>Syntax rules come in two flavors, pertaining to <strong>tokens</strong> and structure. Tokens are the basic<br>
elements of the language, such as words, numbers, and chemical elements. One of the<br>
problems with 3+ =3$6 is that $ is not a legal token in mathematics (at least as far as I<br>
know). Similarly, 2 Zzis not legal because there is no element with the abbreviationZz.</p>
<p>The second type of syntax rule pertains to the structure of a statement; that is, the way the<br>
tokens are arranged. The statement 3+ =3 is illegal because even though+and=are<br>
legal tokens, you can’t have one right after the other. Similarly, in a chemical formula the<br>
subscript comes after the element name, not before.<br>
<strong>Exercise 1.1.</strong> Write a well-structured English sentence with invalid tokens in it. Then write an-<br>
other sentence with all valid tokens but with invalid structure.</p>
<p>When you read a sentence in English or a statement in a formal language, you have to<br>
figure out what the structure of the sentence is (although in a natural language you do this<br>
subconsciously). This process is called <strong>parsing</strong>.</p>
<p>For example, when you hear the sentence, “The penny dropped,” you understand that<br>
“the penny” is the subject and “dropped” is the predicate. Once you have parsed a sen-<br>
tence, you can figure out what it means, or the semantics of the sentence. Assuming that<br>
you know what a penny is and what it means to drop, you will understand the general<br>
implication of this sentence.</p>
<p>Although formal and natural languages have many features in common—tokens, struc-<br>
ture, syntax, and semantics—there are some differences:</p>
<p><strong>ambiguity:</strong> Natural languages are full of ambiguity, which people deal with by using con-<br>
textual clues and other information. Formal languages are designed to be nearly or<br>
completely unambiguous, which means that any statement has exactly one meaning,<br>
regardless of context.</p>
<p><strong>redundancy:</strong> In order to make up for ambiguity and reduce misunderstandings, natural<br>
languages employ lots of redundancy. As a result, they are often verbose. Formal<br>
languages are less redundant and more concise.</p>
<p><strong>6 Chapter 1. The way of the program</strong></p>
<p><strong>literalness:</strong> Natural languages are full of idiom and metaphor. If I say, “The penny<br>
dropped,” there is probably no penny and nothing dropping (this idiom means that<br>
someone realized something after a period of confusion). Formal languages mean<br>
exactly what they say.</p>
<p>People who grow up speaking a natural language—everyone—often have a hard time ad-<br>
justing to formal languages. In some ways, the difference between formal and natural<br>
language is like the difference between poetry and prose, but more so:</p>
<p><strong>Poetry:</strong> Words are used for their sounds as well as for their meaning, and the whole poem<br>
together creates an effect or emotional response. Ambiguity is not only common but<br>
often deliberate.</p>
<p><strong>Prose:</strong> The literal meaning of words is more important, and the structure contributes more<br>
meaning. Prose is more amenable to analysis than poetry but still often ambiguous.</p>
<p><strong>Programs:</strong> The meaning of a computer program is unambiguous and literal, and can be<br>
understood entirely by analysis of the tokens and structure.</p>
<p>Here are some suggestions for reading programs (and other formal languages). First, re-<br>
member that formal languages are much more dense than natural languages, so it takes<br>
longer to read them. Also, the structure is very important, so it is usually not a good idea<br>
to read from top to bottom, left to right. Instead, learn to parse the program in your head,<br>
identifying the tokens and interpreting the structure. Finally, the details matter. Small er-<br>
rors in spelling and punctuation, which you can get away with in natural languages, can<br>
make a big difference in a formal language.</p>
<h3 id="the-first-program">1.5 The first program</h3>
<p>Traditionally, the first program you write in a new language is called “Hello, World!” be-<br>
cause all it does is display the words “Hello, World!”. In Python, it looks like this:</p>
<p>print ‘Hello, World!’</p>
<p>This is an example of a <strong>print statement</strong> , which doesn’t actually print anything on paper. It<br>
displays a value on the screen. In this case, the result is the words</p>
<p>Hello, World!</p>
<p>The quotation marks in the program mark the beginning and end of the text to be dis-<br>
played; they don’t appear in the result.</p>
<p>In Python 3, the syntax for printing is slightly different:</p>
<p>print(‘Hello, World!’)</p>
<p>The parentheses indicate thatprintis a function. We’ll get to functions in Chapter 3.</p>
<p>For the rest of this book, I’ll use the print statement. If you are using Python 3, you will<br>
have to translate. But other than that, there are very few differences we have to worry<br>
about.</p>
<p><strong>1.6. Debugging 7</strong></p>
<h3 id="debugging">1.6 Debugging</h3>
<p>It is a good idea to read this book in front of a computer so you can try out the examples as<br>
you go. You can run most of the examples in interactive mode, but if you put the code in a<br>
script, it is easier to try out variations.</p>
<p>Whenever you are experimenting with a new feature, you should try to make mistakes.<br>
For example, in the “Hello, world!” program, what happens if you leave out one of the<br>
quotation marks? What if you leave out both? What if you spellprintwrong?</p>
<p>This kind of experiment helps you remember what you read; it also helps with debugging,<br>
because you get to know what the error messages mean. It is better to make mistakes now<br>
and on purpose than later and accidentally.</p>
<p>Programming, and especially debugging, sometimes brings out strong emotions. If you<br>
are struggling with a difficult bug, you might feel angry, despondent or embarrassed.</p>
<p>There is evidence that people naturally respond to computers as if they were people. When<br>
they work well, we think of them as teammates, and when they are obstinate or rude, we<br>
respond to them the same way we respond to rude, obstinate people (Reeves and Nass,<br>
The Media Equation: How People Treat Computers, Television, and New Media Like Real People<br>
and Places).</p>
<p>Preparing for these reactions might help you deal with them. One approach is to think of<br>
the computer as an employee with certain strengths, like speed and precision, and partic-<br>
ular weaknesses, like lack of empathy and inability to grasp the big picture.</p>
<p>Your job is to be a good manager: find ways to take advantage of the strengths and mitigate<br>
the weaknesses. And find ways to use your emotions to engage with the problem, without<br>
letting your reactions interfere with your ability to work effectively.</p>
<p>Learning to debug can be frustrating, but it is a valuable skill that is useful for many ac-<br>
tivities beyond programming. At the end of each chapter there is a debugging section, like<br>
this one, with my thoughts about debugging. I hope they help!</p>

<h3 id="exercises">1.8 Exercises</h3>
<p><strong>Exercise 1.2.</strong> Use a web browser to go to the Python websitehttp: // python. org. This page<br>
contains information about Python and links to Python-related pages, and it gives you the ability to<br>
search the Python documentation.</p>
<p>For example, if you enterprintin the search window, the first link that appears is the documenta-<br>
tion of theprintstatement. At this point, not all of it will make sense to you, but it is good to know<br>
where it is.<br>
<strong>Exercise 1.3.</strong> Start the Python interpreter and typehelp()to start the online help utility. Or you<br>
can typehelp(‘print’)to get information about theprintstatement.</p>
<p>If this example doesn’t work, you may need to install additional Python documentation or set an<br>
environment variable; the details depend on your operating system and version of Python.<br>
<strong>Exercise 1.4.</strong> Start the Python interpreter and use it as a calculator. Python’s syntax for math<br>
operations is almost the same as standard mathematical notation. For example, the symbols+,-and<br>
/denote addition, subtraction and division, as you would expect. The symbol for multiplication is<br>
*.</p>
<p>If you run a 10 kilometer race in 43 minutes 30 seconds, what is your average time per mile? What<br>
is your average speed in miles per hour? (Hint: there are 1.61 kilometers in a mile).</p>

<h3 id="values-and-types">2.1 Values and types</h3>
<p>A <strong>value</strong> is one of the basic things a program works with, like a letter or a number. The<br>
values we have seen so far are 1 , 2 , and’Hello, World!’.</p>
<p>These values belong to different <strong>types</strong> : 2 is an integer, and’Hello, World!'is a <strong>string</strong> ,<br>
so-called because it contains a “string” of letters. You (and the interpreter) can identify<br>
strings because they are enclosed in quotation marks.</p>
<p>If you are not sure what type a value has, the interpreter can tell you.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>type(‘Hello, World!’)<br>
&lt;type’str’&gt;</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>type(17)<br>
&lt;type’int’&gt;</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Not surprisingly, strings belong to the typestrand integers belong to the typeint. Less<br>
obviously, numbers with a decimal point belong to a type calledfloat, because these num-<br>
bers are represented in a format called <strong>floating-point</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>type(3.2)<br>
&lt;type’float’&gt;</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>What about values like’ 17 ‘and’3.2’? They look like numbers, but they are in quotation<br>
marks like strings.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>type(’ 17 ‘)<br>
&lt;type’str’&gt;</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>type(‘3.2’)<br>
&lt;type’str’&gt;</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>They’re strings.</p>
<p>When you type a large integer, you might be tempted to use commas between groups of<br>
three digits, as in1,000,000. This is not a legal integer in Python, but it is legal:</p>
<p><strong>12 Chapter 2. Variables, expressions and statements</strong></p>
<pre><code>message
n
pi
</code></pre>
<pre><code>17
</code></pre>
<pre><code>’And now for something completely different’
</code></pre>
<pre><code>3.1415926535897932
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Figure 2.1: State diagram.
</code></pre>
<h4 id="section">&gt;&gt;&gt; 1,000,000</h4>
<h4 id="section-1">(1, 0, 0)</h4>
<p>Well, that’s not what we expected at all! Python interprets1,000,000as a comma-<br>
separated sequence of integers. This is the first example we have seen of a semantic error:<br>
the code runs without producing an error message, but it doesn’t do the “right” thing.</p>
<h3 id="variables">2.2 Variables</h3>
<p>One of the most powerful features of a programming language is the ability to manipulate<br>
<strong>variables</strong>. A variable is a name that refers to a value.</p>
<p>An <strong>assignment statement</strong> creates new variables and gives them values:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>message = ‘And now for something completely different’<br>
n = 17<br>
pi = 3.1415926535897932</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>This example makes three assignments. The first assigns a string to a new variable named<br>
message; the second gives the integer 17 ton; the third assigns the (approximate) value of<br>
<em>π</em> topi.</p>
<p>A common way to represent variables on paper is to write the name with an arrow pointing<br>
to the variable’s value. This kind of figure is called a <strong>state diagram</strong> because it shows what<br>
state each of the variables is in (think of it as the variable’s state of mind). Figure 2.1 shows<br>
the result of the previous example.</p>
<p>The type of a variable is the type of the value it refers to.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>type(message)<br>
&lt;type ‘str’&gt;</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>type(n)<br>
&lt;type ‘int’&gt;</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>type(pi)<br>
&lt;type ‘float’&gt;</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="variable-names-and-keywords">2.3 Variable names and keywords</h3>
<p>Programmers generally choose names for their variables that are meaningful—they docu-<br>
ment what the variable is used for.</p>
<p>Variable names can be arbitrarily long. They can contain both letters and numbers, but<br>
they have to begin with a letter. It is legal to use uppercase letters, but it is a good idea to<br>
begin variable names with a lowercase letter (you’ll see why later).</p>
<p><strong>2.4. Operators and operands 13</strong></p>
<p>The underscore character,_, can appear in a name. It is often used in names with multiple<br>
words, such asmy_nameorairspeed_of_unladen_swallow.</p>
<p>If you give a variable an illegal name, you get a syntax error:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>76trombones =‘big parade’<br>
SyntaxError: invalid syntax</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>more@ = 1000000<br>
SyntaxError: invalid syntax</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>class =‘Advanced Theoretical Zymurgy’<br>
SyntaxError: invalid syntax</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>76trombonesis illegal because it does not begin with a letter.more@is illegal because it<br>
contains an illegal character,@. But what’s wrong withclass?</p>
<p>It turns out thatclassis one of Python’s <strong>keywords</strong>. The interpreter uses keywords to<br>
recognize the structure of the program, and they cannot be used as variable names.</p>
<p>Python 2 has 31 keywords:</p>
<p>and del from not while<br>
as elif global or with<br>
assert else if pass yield<br>
break except import print<br>
class exec in raise<br>
continue finally is return<br>
def for lambda try</p>
<p>In Python 3,execis no longer a keyword, butnonlocalis.</p>
<p>You might want to keep this list handy. If the interpreter complains about one of your<br>
variable names and you don’t know why, see if it is on this list.</p>
<h2 id="operators-and-operands">2.4 Operators and operands</h2>
<p><strong>Operators</strong> are special symbols that represent computations like addition and multiplica-<br>
tion. The values the operator is applied to are called <strong>operands</strong>.</p>
<p>The operators <code>+,-,*,/</code> and <code>**</code>* perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and exponentiation, as in the following examples:</p>
<p><code>20 + 32 hour - 1 hour* 60 + minute minute/60 5**2 (5+9)*(15-7)</code></p>
<p>In some other languages, <code>^</code>is used for exponentiation, but in Python it is a bitwise operator called <code>XOR</code>. I won’t cover bitwise operators in this book, but you can read about them at<br>
<a href="http://wiki.python.org/moin/BitwiseOperators">http://wiki.python.org/moin/BitwiseOperators</a></p>
<p>In Python 2, the division operator might not do what you expect:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>minute = 59<br>
minute/60<br>
0</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The value ofminuteis 59, and in conventional arithmetic 59 divided by 60 is 0.98333, not 0. The reason for the discrepancy is that Python is performing <strong>floor division</strong>. When both of the operands are integers, the result is also an integer; floor division chops off the fraction part, so in this example it rounds down to zero.</p>
<p><strong>14 Chapter 2. Variables, expressions and statements</strong></p>
<p>In Python 3, the result of this division is afloat. The new operator//performs floor<br>
division.</p>
<p>If either of the operands is a floating-point number, Python performs floating-point divi-<br>
sion, and the result is afloat:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>minute/60.0<br>
0.98333333333333328</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="expressions-and-statements">2.5 Expressions and statements</h3>
<p>An <strong>expression</strong> is a combination of values, variables, and operators. A value all by itself<br>
is considered an expression, and so is a variable, so the following are all legal expressions<br>
(assuming that the variablexhas been assigned a value):</p>
<p>17<br>
x<br>
x + 17</p>
<p>A <strong>statement</strong> is a unit of code that the Python interpreter can execute. We have seen two<br>
kinds of statement: print and assignment.</p>
<p>Technically an expression is also a statement, but it is probably simpler to think of them<br>
as different things. The important difference is that an expression has a value; a statement<br>
does not.</p>
<h3 id="interactive-mode-and-script-mode">2.6 Interactive mode and script mode</h3>
<p>One of the benefits of working with an interpreted language is that you can test bits of<br>
code in interactive mode before you put them in a script. But there are differences between<br>
interactive mode and script mode that can be confusing.</p>
<p>For example, if you are using Python as a calculator, you might type</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>miles = 26.2<br>
miles * 1.61<br>
42.182</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The first line assigns a value tomiles, but it has no visible effect. The second line is an ex-<br>
pression, so the interpreter evaluates it and displays the result. So we learn that a marathon<br>
is about 42 kilometers.</p>
<p>But if you type the same code into a script and run it, you get no output at all. In script<br>
mode an expression, all by itself, has no visible effect. Python actually evaluates the ex-<br>
pression, but it doesn’t display the value unless you tell it to:</p>
<p>miles = 26.2<br>
print miles * 1.61</p>
<p>This behavior can be confusing at first.</p>
<p>A script usually contains a sequence of statements. If there is more than one statement, the<br>
results appear one at a time as the statements execute.</p>
<p>For example, the script</p>
<p><strong>2.7. Order of operations 15</strong></p>
<p>print 1<br>
x = 2<br>
print x</p>
<p>produces the output</p>
<p>1<br>
2</p>
<p>The assignment statement produces no output.<br>
<strong>Exercise 2.1.</strong> Type the following statements in the Python interpreter to see what they do:</p>
<p>5<br>
x = 5<br>
x + 1</p>
<p>Now put the same statements into a script and run it. What is the output? Modify the script by<br>
transforming each expression into a print statement and then run it again.</p>
<h3 id="order-of-operations">2.7 Order of operations</h3>
<p>When more than one operator appears in an expression, the order of evaluation depends<br>
on the <strong>rules of precedence</strong>. For mathematical operators, Python follows mathematical<br>
convention. The acronym <strong>PEMDAS</strong> is a useful way to remember the rules:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>P</strong> arentheses have the highest precedence and can be used to force an expression to<br>
evaluate in the order you want. Since expressions in parentheses are evaluated first,<br>
2 * (3-1)is 4, and(1+1)**(5-2)is 8. You can also use parentheses to make an<br>
expression easier to read, as in(minute * 100) / 60, even if it doesn’t change the<br>
result.</li>
<li><strong>E</strong> xponentiation has the next highest precedence, so2<strong>1+1is 3, not 4, and3*1</strong>3is<br>
3, not 27.</li>
<li><strong>M</strong> ultiplication and <strong>D</strong> ivision have the same precedence, which is higher than<br>
<strong>A</strong> ddition and <strong>S</strong> ubtraction, which also have the same precedence. So2*3-1is 5, not<br>
4, and6+4/2is 8, not 5.</li>
<li>Operators with the same precedence are evaluated from left to right (except exponen-<br>
tiation). So in the expressiondegrees / 2 * pi, the division happens first and the<br>
result is multiplied bypi. To divide by 2 <em>π</em> , you can use parentheses or writedegrees<br>
/ 2 / pi.</li>
</ul>
<p>I don’t work very hard to remember rules of precedence for other operators. If I can’t tell<br>
by looking at the expression, I use parentheses to make it obvious.</p>
<h3 id="string-operations">2.8 String operations</h3>
<p>In general, you can’t perform mathematical operations on strings, even if the strings look<br>
like numbers, so the following are illegal:</p>
<p>’ 2 ‘-’ 1 '‘eggs’/‘easy’‘third’*‘a charm’</p>
<p><strong>16 Chapter 2. Variables, expressions and statements</strong></p>
<p>The+operator works with strings, but it might not do what you expect: it performs <strong>con-<br>
catenation</strong> , which means joining the strings by linking them end-to-end. For example:</p>
<p>first =‘throat’<br>
second =‘warbler’<br>
print first + second</p>
<p>The output of this program isthroatwarbler.</p>
<p>The*operator also works on strings; it performs repetition. For example,‘Spam’*3is<br>
‘SpamSpamSpam’. If one of the operands is a string, the other has to be an integer.</p>
<p>This use of+and<em>makes sense by analogy with addition and multiplication. Just as4</em>3<br>
is equivalent to4+4+4, we expect’Spam’*3to be the same as’Spam’+‘Spam’+‘Spam’, and<br>
it is. On the other hand, there is a significant way in which string concatenation and repe-<br>
tition are different from integer addition and multiplication. Can you think of a property<br>
that addition has that string concatenation does not?</p>
<h3 id="comments">2.9 Comments</h3>
<p>As programs get bigger and more complicated, they get more difficult to read. Formal<br>
languages are dense, and it is often difficult to look at a piece of code and figure out what<br>
it is doing, or why.</p>
<p>For this reason, it is a good idea to add notes to your programs to explain in natural lan-<br>
guage what the program is doing. These notes are called <strong>comments</strong> , and they start with<br>
the#symbol:</p>
<h1 id="compute-the-percentage-of-the-hour-that-has-elapsed">compute the percentage of the hour that has elapsed</h1>
<p>percentage = (minute * 100) / 60</p>
<p>In this case, the comment appears on a line by itself. You can also put comments at the end<br>
of a line:</p>
<p>percentage = (minute * 100) / 60 # percentage of an hour</p>
<p>Everything from the#to the end of the line is ignored—it has no effect on the program.</p>
<p>Comments are most useful when they document non-obvious features of the code. It is<br>
reasonable to assume that the reader can figure outwhatthe code does; it is much more<br>
useful to explainwhy.</p>
<p>This comment is redundant with the code and useless:</p>
<p>v = 5 # assign 5 to v</p>
<p>This comment contains useful information that is not in the code:</p>
<p>v = 5 # velocity in meters/second.</p>
<p>Good variable names can reduce the need for comments, but long names can make com-<br>
plex expressions hard to read, so there is a tradeoff.</p>
<h3 id="debugging-1">2.10 Debugging</h3>
<p>At this point the syntax error you are most likely to make is an illegal variable name, like<br>
classandyield, which are keywords, orodd~jobandUS$, which contain illegal charac-<br>
ters.</p>
<p><strong>2.11. Glossary 17</strong></p>
<p>If you put a space in a variable name, Python thinks it is two operands without an operator:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>bad name = 5<br>
SyntaxError: invalid syntax</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>For syntax errors, the error messages don’t help much. The most common messages are<br>
SyntaxError: invalid syntaxandSyntaxError: invalid token, neither of which is<br>
very informative.</p>
<p>The runtime error you are most likely to make is a “use before def;” that is, trying to use<br>
a variable before you have assigned a value. This can happen if you spell a variable name<br>
wrong:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>principal = 327.68<br>
interest = principle * rate<br>
NameError: name’principle’is not defined</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Variables names are case sensitive, soLaTeXis not the same aslatex.</p>
<p>At this point the most likely cause of a semantic error is the order of operations. For exam-<br>
ple, to evaluate 21 <em>π</em> , you might be tempted to write</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>1.0 / 2.0 * pi</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>But the division happens first, so you would get <em>π</em> /2, which is not the same thing! There is<br>
no way for Python to know what you meant to write, so in this case you don’t get an error<br>
message; you just get the wrong answer.</p>

<h1 id="functions">Functions</h1>
<h3 id="function-calls">3.1 Function calls</h3>
<p>In the context of programming, a <strong>function</strong> is a named sequence of statements that performs<br>
a computation. When you define a function, you specify the name and the sequence of<br>
statements. Later, you can “call” the function by name. We have already seen one example<br>
of a <strong>function call</strong> :</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>type(32)<br>
&lt;type’int’&gt;</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The name of the function istype. The expression in parentheses is called the <strong>argument</strong> of<br>
the function. The result, for this function, is the type of the argument.</p>
<p>It is common to say that a function “takes” an argument and “returns” a result. The result<br>
is called the <strong>return value</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="type-conversion-functions">3.2 Type conversion functions</h3>
<p>Python provides built-in functions that convert values from one type to another. Theint<br>
function takes any value and converts it to an integer, if it can, or complains otherwise:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>int(’ 32 ')<br>
32</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>int(‘Hello’)<br>
ValueError: invalid literal for int(): Hello</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>intcan convert floating-point values to integers, but it doesn’t round off; it chops off the<br>
fraction part:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>int(3.99999)<br>
3</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>int(-2.3)<br>
-2</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>floatconverts integers and strings to floating-point numbers:</p>
<p><strong>20 Chapter 3. Functions</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>float(32)<br>
32.0</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>float(‘3.14159’)<br>
3.14159</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally,strconverts its argument to a string:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>str(32)<br>
’ 32 ’</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>str(3.14159)<br>
‘3.14159’</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="math-functions">3.3 Math functions</h3>
<p>Python has a math module that provides most of the familiar mathematical functions. A<br>
<strong>module</strong> is a file that contains a collection of related functions.</p>
<p>Before we can use the module, we have to import it:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>import math</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>This statement creates a <strong>module object</strong> named math. If you print the module object, you<br>
get some information about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>print math<br>
&lt;module’math’ (built-in)&gt;</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The module object contains the functions and variables defined in the module. To access<br>
one of the functions, you have to specify the name of the module and the name of the<br>
function, separated by a dot (also known as a period). This format is called <strong>dot notation</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>ratio = signal_power / noise_power<br>
decibels = 10 * math.log10(ratio)</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>radians = 0.7<br>
height = math.sin(radians)</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The first example useslog10to compute a signal-to-noise ratio in decibels (assuming that<br>
signal_powerandnoise_powerare defined). The math module also provideslog, which<br>
computes logarithms basee.</p>
<p>The second example finds the sine ofradians. The name of the variable is a hint thatsin<br>
and the other trigonometric functions (cos,tan, etc.) take arguments in radians. To convert<br>
from degrees to radians, divide by 360 and multiply by 2 <em>π</em> :</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>

<p><strong>3.4. Composition 21</strong></p>
<h3 id="composition">3.4 Composition</h3>
<p>So far, we have looked at the elements of a program—variables, expressions, and<br>
statements—in isolation, without talking about how to combine them.</p>
<p>One of the most useful features of programming languages is their ability to take small<br>
building blocks and <strong>compose</strong> them. For example, the argument of a function can be any<br>
kind of expression, including arithmetic operators:</p>
<p>x = math.sin(degrees / 360.0 * 2 * math.pi)</p>
<p>And even function calls:</p>
<p>x = math.exp(math.log(x+1))</p>
<p>Almost anywhere you can put a value, you can put an arbitrary expression, with one ex-<br>
ception: the left side of an assignment statement has to be a variable name. Any other<br>
expression on the left side is a syntax error (we will see exceptions to this rule later).</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>minutes = hours * 60 # right<br>
hours * 60 = minutes # wrong!<br>
SyntaxError: can’t assign to operator</p>

<h3 id="adding-new-functions">3.5 Adding new functions</h3>
<p>So far, we have only been using the functions that come with Python, but it is also possible<br>
to add new functions. A <strong>function definition</strong> specifies the name of a new function and the<br>
sequence of statements that execute when the function is called.</p>
<p>Here is an example:</p>
<p>def print_lyrics():<br>
print “I’m a lumberjack, and I’m okay.”<br>
print “I sleep all night and I work all day.”</p>
<p>defis a keyword that indicates that this is a function definition. The name of the function<br>
isprint_lyrics. The rules for function names are the same as for variable names: letters,<br>
numbers and some punctuation marks are legal, but the first character can’t be a number.<br>
You can’t use a keyword as the name of a function, and you should avoid having a variable<br>
and a function with the same name.</p>
<p>The empty parentheses after the name indicate that this function doesn’t take any argu-<br>
ments.</p>
<p>The first line of the function definition is called the <strong>header</strong> ; the rest is called the <strong>body</strong>.<br>
The header has to end with a colon and the body has to be indented. By convention, the<br>
indentation is always four spaces (see Section 3.14). The body can contain any number of<br>
statements.</p>
<p>The strings in the print statements are enclosed in double quotes. Single quotes and double<br>
quotes do the same thing; most people use single quotes except in cases like this where a<br>
single quote (which is also an apostrophe) appears in the string.</p>
<p>If you type a function definition in interactive mode, the interpreter prints ellipses (…) to<br>
let you know that the definition isn’t complete:</p>
<p><strong>22 Chapter 3. Functions</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>def print_lyrics():<br>
… print “I’m a lumberjack, and I’m okay.”<br>
… print “I sleep all night and I work all day.”</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>To end the function, you have to enter an empty line (this is not necessary in a script).</p>
<p>Defining a function creates a variable with the same name.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>print print_lyrics<br>
&lt;function print_lyrics at 0xb7e99e9c&gt;</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>type(print_lyrics)<br>
&lt;type ‘function’&gt;</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The value ofprint_lyricsis a <strong>function object</strong> , which has type’function’.</p>
<p>The syntax for calling the new function is the same as for built-in functions:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>print_lyrics()<br>
I’m a lumberjack, and I’m okay.<br>
I sleep all night and I work all day.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Once you have defined a function, you can use it inside another function. For example, to<br>
repeat the previous refrain, we could write a function calledrepeat_lyrics:</p>
<p>def repeat_lyrics():<br>
print_lyrics()<br>
print_lyrics()</p>
<p>And then callrepeat_lyrics:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>repeat_lyrics()<br>
I’m a lumberjack, and I’m okay.<br>
I sleep all night and I work all day.<br>
I’m a lumberjack, and I’m okay.<br>
I sleep all night and I work all day.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>But that’s not really how the song goes.</p>
<h3 id="definitions-and-uses">3.6 Definitions and uses</h3>
<p>Pulling together the code fragments from the previous section, the whole program looks<br>
like this:</p>
<p>def print_lyrics():<br>
print “I’m a lumberjack, and I’m okay.”<br>
print “I sleep all night and I work all day.”</p>
<p>def repeat_lyrics():<br>
print_lyrics()<br>
print_lyrics()</p>
<p>repeat_lyrics()</p>
<p>This program contains two function definitions:print_lyricsandrepeat_lyrics. Func-<br>
tion definitions get executed just like other statements, but the effect is to create function<br>
objects. The statements inside the function do not get executed until the function is called,<br>
and the function definition generates no output.</p>
<p><strong>3.7. Flow of execution 23</strong></p>
<p>As you might expect, you have to create a function before you can execute it. In other<br>
words, the function definition has to be executed before the first time it is called.<br>
<strong>Exercise 3.1.</strong> Move the last line of this program to the top, so the function call appears before the<br>
definitions. Run the program and see what error message you get.<br>
<strong>Exercise 3.2.</strong> Move the function call back to the bottom and move the definition ofprint_lyrics<br>
after the definition ofrepeat_lyrics. What happens when you run this program?</p>
<h3 id="flow-of-execution">3.7 Flow of execution</h3>
<p>In order to ensure that a function is defined before its first use, you have to know the order<br>
in which statements are executed, which is called the <strong>flow of execution</strong>.</p>
<p>Execution always begins at the first statement of the program. Statements are executed one<br>
at a time, in order from top to bottom.</p>
<p>Function definitions do not alter the flow of execution of the program, but remember that<br>
statements inside the function are not executed until the function is called.</p>
<p>A function call is like a detour in the flow of execution. Instead of going to the next state-<br>
ment, the flow jumps to the body of the function, executes all the statements there, and<br>
then comes back to pick up where it left off.</p>
<p>That sounds simple enough, until you remember that one function can call another. While<br>
in the middle of one function, the program might have to execute the statements in another<br>
function. But while executing that new function, the program might have to execute yet<br>
another function!</p>
<p>Fortunately, Python is good at keeping track of where it is, so each time a function com-<br>
pletes, the program picks up where it left off in the function that called it. When it gets to<br>
the end of the program, it terminates.</p>
<p>What’s the moral of this sordid tale? When you read a program, you don’t always want<br>
to read from top to bottom. Sometimes it makes more sense if you follow the flow of<br>
execution.</p>
<h3 id="parameters-and-arguments">3.8 Parameters and arguments</h3>
<p>Some of the built-in functions we have seen require arguments. For example, when you<br>
callmath.sinyou pass a number as an argument. Some functions take more than one<br>
argument:math.powtakes two, the base and the exponent.</p>
<p>Inside the function, the arguments are assigned to variables called <strong>parameters</strong>. Here is an<br>
example of a user-defined function that takes an argument:</p>
<p>def print_twice(bruce):<br>
print bruce<br>
print bruce</p>
<p>This function assigns the argument to a parameter namedbruce. When the function is<br>
called, it prints the value of the parameter (whatever it is) twice.</p>
<p>This function works with any value that can be printed.</p>
<p><strong>24 Chapter 3. Functions</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>print_twice(‘Spam’)<br>
Spam<br>
Spam</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>print_twice(17)<br>
17<br>

</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>print_twice(math.pi)<br>
3.14159265359<br>
3.14159265359</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The same rules of composition that apply to built-in functions also apply to user-defined<br>
functions, so we can use any kind of expression as an argument forprint_twice:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>print_twice(‘Spam’*4)<br>
Spam Spam Spam Spam<br>
Spam Spam Spam Spam</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>print_twice(math.cos(math.pi))<br>
-1.0<br>
-1.0</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The argument is evaluated before the function is called, so in the examples the expressions<br>
‘Spam’*4andmath.cos(math.pi)are only evaluated once.</p>
<p>You can also use a variable as an argument:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>michael = ‘Eric, the half a bee.’<br>
print_twice(michael)<br>
Eric, the half a bee.<br>
Eric, the half a bee.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The name of the variable we pass as an argument (michael) has nothing to do with the<br>
name of the parameter (bruce). It doesn’t matter what the value was called back home (in<br>
the caller); here inprint_twice, we call everybodybruce.</p>
<h3 id="variables-and-parameters-are-local">3.9 Variables and parameters are local</h3>
<p>When you create a variable inside a function, it is <strong>local</strong> , which means that it only exists<br>
inside the function. For example:</p>
<p>def cat_twice(part1, part2):<br>
cat = part1 + part2<br>
print_twice(cat)</p>
<p>This function takes two arguments, concatenates them, and prints the result twice. Here is<br>
an example that uses it:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>line1 =‘Bing tiddle’<br>
line2 =‘tiddle bang.’<br>
cat_twice(line1, line2)<br>
Bing tiddle tiddle bang.<br>
Bing tiddle tiddle bang.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Whencat_twiceterminates, the variablecatis destroyed. If we try to print it, we get an<br>
exception:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>print cat<br>
NameError: name 'cat’is not defined</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>Parameters are also local. For example, outsideprint_twice, there is no such thing as<br>

<h3 id="stack-diagrams">3.10 Stack diagrams</h3>
<p>To keep track of which variables can be used where, it is sometimes useful to draw a <strong>stack<br>
diagram</strong>. Like state diagrams, stack diagrams show the value of each variable, but they<br>
also show the function each variable belongs to.</p>
<p>Each function is represented by a <strong>frame</strong>. A frame is a box with the name of a function<br>
beside it and the parameters and variables of the function inside it. The stack diagram for<br>
the previous example is shown in Figure 3.1.</p>
<p>The frames are arranged in a stack that indicates which function called which, and so<br>
on. In this example,print_twicewas called bycat_twice, andcat_twicewas called<br>
by__main__, which is a special name for the topmost frame. When you create a variable<br>
outside of any function, it belongs to__main__.</p>
<p>Each parameter refers to the same value as its corresponding argument. So,part1has the<br>
same value asline1,part2has the same value asline2, andbrucehas the same value as<br>
cat.</p>
<p>If an error occurs during a function call, Python prints the name of the function, and the<br>
name of the function that called it, and the name of the function that calledthat, all the way<br>
back to__main__.</p>
<p>For example, if you try to accesscatfrom withinprint_twice, you get aNameError:</p>
<p>Traceback (innermost last):<br>
File “<a href="http://test.py">test.py</a>”, line 13, in <strong>main</strong><br>
cat_twice(line1, line2)<br>
File “<a href="http://test.py">test.py</a>”, line 5, in cat_twice<br>
print_twice(cat)<br>
File “<a href="http://test.py">test.py</a>”, line 9, in print_twice<br>
print cat<br>
NameError: name’cat’ is not defined</p>
<p>This list of functions is called a <strong>traceback</strong>. It tells you what program file the error occurred<br>
in, and what line, and what functions were executing at the time. It also shows the line of<br>
code that caused the error.</p>
<p><strong>26 Chapter 3. Functions</strong></p>
<p>The order of the functions in the traceback is the same as the order of the frames in the<br>
stack diagram. The function that is currently running is at the bottom.</p>
<h3 id="fruitful-functions-and-void-functions">3.11 Fruitful functions and void functions</h3>
<p>Some of the functions we are using, such as the math functions, yield results; for lack of a<br>
better name, I call them <strong>fruitful functions</strong>. Other functions, likeprint_twice, perform an<br>
action but don’t return a value. They are called <strong>void functions</strong>.</p>
<p>When you call a fruitful function, you almost always want to do something with the result;<br>
for example, you might assign it to a variable or use it as part of an expression:</p>
<p>x = math.cos(radians)<br>
golden = (math.sqrt(5) + 1) / 2</p>
<p>When you call a function in interactive mode, Python displays the result:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>math.sqrt(5)<br>
2.2360679774997898</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>But in a script, if you call a fruitful function all by itself, the return value is lost forever!</p>
<p>math.sqrt(5)</p>
<p>This script computes the square root of 5, but since it doesn’t store or display the result, it<br>
is not very useful.</p>
<p>Void functions might display something on the screen or have some other effect, but they<br>
don’t have a return value. If you try to assign the result to a variable, you get a special<br>
value calledNone.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>result = print_twice(‘Bing’)<br>
Bing<br>
Bing</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>print result<br>
None</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The valueNoneis not the same as the string’None’. It is a special value that has its own<br>
type:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>print type(None)<br>
&lt;type ‘NoneType’&gt;</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The functions we have written so far are all void. We will start writing fruitful functions in<br>
a few chapters.</p>
<h3 id="why-functions">3.12 Why functions?</h3>
<p>It may not be clear why it is worth the trouble to divide a program into functions. There<br>
are several reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating a new function gives you an opportunity to name a group of statements,<br>
which makes your program easier to read and debug.</li>
<li>Functions can make a program smaller by eliminating repetitive code. Later, if you<br>
make a change, you only have to make it in one place.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3.13. Importing with</strong> from <strong>27</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Dividing a long program into functions allows you to debug the parts one at a time<br>
and then assemble them into a working whole.</li>
<li>Well-designed functions are often useful for many programs. Once you write and<br>
debug one, you can reuse it.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="importing-withfrom">3.13 Importing withfrom</h3>
<p>Python provides two ways to import modules; we have already seen one:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>import math<br>
print math<br>
&lt;module’math’(built-in)&gt;</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>print math.pi<br>
3.14159265359</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>If you importmath, you get a module object namedmath. The module object contains<br>
constants likepiand functions likesinandexp.</p>
<p>But if you try to accesspidirectly, you get an error.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>print pi<br>
Traceback (most recent call last):<br>
File “”, line 1, in <br>
NameError: name’pi’is not defined</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>As an alternative, you can import an object from a module like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>from math import pi</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Now you can accesspidirectly, without dot notation.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>print pi<br>
3.14159265359</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Or you can use the star operator to importeverythingfrom the module:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>from math import *<br>
cos(pi)<br>
-1.0</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The advantage of importing everything from the math module is that your code can be<br>
more concise. The disadvantage is that there might be conflicts between names defined in<br>
different modules, or between a name from a module and one of your variables.</p>
<h3 id="debugging-2">3.14 Debugging</h3>
<p>If you are using a text editor to write your scripts, you might run into problems with spaces<br>
and tabs. The best way to avoid these problems is to use spaces exclusively (no tabs). Most<br>
text editors that know about Python do this by default, but some don’t.</p>
<p>Tabs and spaces are usually invisible, which makes them hard to debug, so try to find an<br>
editor that manages indentation for you.</p>
<p>Also, don’t forget to save your program before you run it. Some development environ-<br>
ments do this automatically, but some don’t. In that case the program you are looking at in<br>
the text editor is not the same as the program you are running.</p>
<p><strong>28 Chapter 3. Functions</strong></p>
<p>Debugging can take a long time if you keep running the same, incorrect, program over and<br>
over!</p>
<p>Make sure that the code you are looking at is the code you are running. If you’re not sure,<br>
put something likeprint’hello’at the beginning of the program and run it again. If you<br>
don’t seehello, you’re not running the right program!</p>

Swampy fromhttp://thinkpython.com/swampy; follow the instructions there to install<br>
Swampy on your system.</p>
<p>A <strong>package</strong> is a collection of modules; one of the modules in Swampy isTurtleWorld,<br>

<p>If you downloaded the Swampy modules but did not install them as a package, you can ei-<br>
ther work in the directory that contains the Swampy files, or add that directory to Python’s<br>
search path. Then you can importTurtleWorldlike this:</p>
<p>from TurtleWorld import *</p>
<p>The details of the installation process and setting Python’s search path depend on your<br>
system, so rather than include those details here, I will try to maintain current information<br>
for several systems athttp://thinkpython.com/swampy</p>
<p>Create a file namedmypolygon.pyand type in the following code:</p>
<p>from swampy.TurtleWorld import *</p>
<p>world = TurtleWorld()<br>
bob = Turtle()<br>
print bob</p>
<p>wait_for_user()</p>
<p><strong>32 Chapter 4. Case study: interface design</strong></p>
<p>The first line imports everything from theTurtleWorldmodule in theswampypackage.</p>
<p>The next lines create a TurtleWorld assigned toworldand a Turtle assigned tobob. Printing<br>
bobyields something like:</p>
<p>&lt;TurtleWorld.Turtle instance at 0xb7bfbf4c&gt;</p>
<p>This means thatbobrefers to an <strong>instance</strong> of a Turtle as defined in moduleTurtleWorld.<br>
In this context, “instance” means a member of a set; this Turtle is one of the set of possible<br>
Turtles.</p>
<p>wait_for_usertells TurtleWorld to wait for the user to do something, although in this case<br>
there’s not much for the user to do except close the window.</p>
<p>TurtleWorld provides several turtle-steering functions: fdandbkfor forward and back-<br>
ward, andltandrtfor left and right turns. Also, each Turtle is holding a pen, which is<br>
either down or up; if the pen is down, the Turtle leaves a trail when it moves. The functions<br>
puandpdstand for “pen up” and “pen down.”</p>
<p>To draw a right angle, add these lines to the program (after creatingboband before calling<br>
wait_for_user):</p>
<p>fd(bob, 100)<br>
lt(bob)<br>
fd(bob, 100)</p>
<p>The first line tellsbobto take 100 steps forward. The second line tells him to turn left.</p>
<p>When you run this program, you should seebobmove east and then north, leaving two<br>
line segments behind.</p>
<p>Now modify the program to draw a square. Don’t go on until you’ve got it working!</p>
<h3 id="simple-repetition">4.2 Simple repetition</h3>
<p>Chances are you wrote something like this (leaving out the code that creates TurtleWorld<br>
and waits for the user):</p>
<p>fd(bob, 100)<br>
lt(bob)</p>
<p>fd(bob, 100)<br>
lt(bob)</p>
<p>fd(bob, 100)<br>
lt(bob)</p>
<p>fd(bob, 100)</p>
<p>We can do the same thing more concisely with aforstatement. Add this example to<br>
mypolygon.pyand run it again:</p>
<p>for i in range(4):<br>
print ‘Hello!’</p>
<p>You should see something like this:</p>
<p><strong>4.3. Exercises 33</strong></p>
<p>Hello!<br>
Hello!<br>
Hello!<br>
Hello!</p>
<p>This is the simplest use of theforstatement; we will see more later. But that should be<br>
enough to let you rewrite your square-drawing program. Don’t go on until you do.</p>
<p>Here is aforstatement that draws a square:</p>
<p>for i in range(4):<br>
fd(bob, 100)<br>
lt(bob)</p>
<p>The syntax of aforstatement is similar to a function definition. It has a header that ends<br>
with a colon and an indented body. The body can contain any number of statements.</p>
<p>Aforstatement is sometimes called a <strong>loop</strong> because the flow of execution runs through the<br>
body and then loops back to the top. In this case, it runs the body four times.</p>
<p>This version is actually a little different from the previous square-drawing code because it<br>
makes another turn after drawing the last side of the square. The extra turn takes a little<br>
more time, but it simplifies the code if we do the same thing every time through the loop.<br>
This version also has the effect of leaving the turtle back in the starting position, facing in<br>
the starting direction.</p>
<h3 id="exercises-3">4.3 Exercises</h3>
<p>The following is a series of exercises using TurtleWorld. They are meant to be fun, but they<br>
have a point, too. While you are working on them, think about what the point is.</p>
<p>The following sections have solutions to the exercises, so don’t look until you have finished<br>
(or at least tried).</p>
<ol>
<li>Write a function calledsquarethat takes a parameter namedt, which is a turtle. It<br>
should use the turtle to draw a square.<br>
Write a function call that passesbobas an argument tosquare, and then run the<br>
program again.</li>
<li>Add another parameter, namedlength, tosquare. Modify the body so length of the<br>
sides islength, and then modify the function call to provide a second argument. Run<br>
the program again. Test your program with a range of values forlength.</li>
<li>The functionsltandrtmake 90-degree turns by default, but you can provide a<br>
second argument that specifies the number of degrees. For example,lt(bob, 45)<br>
turnsbob45 degrees to the left.<br>
Make a copy ofsquareand change the name topolygon. Add another parameter<br>
namednand modify the body so it draws an n-sided regular polygon. Hint: The<br>
exterior angles of an n-sided regular polygon are 360/ndegrees.</li>
<li>Write a function calledcirclethat takes a turtle,t, and radius,r, as parameters and<br>
that draws an approximate circle by invokingpolygonwith an appropriate length<br>
and number of sides. Test your function with a range of values ofr.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>34 Chapter 4. Case study: interface design</strong></p>
<pre><code>Hint: figure out the circumference of the circle and make sure thatlength * n =
circumference.
Another hint: if bobis too slow for you, you can speed him up by changing
bob.delay, which is the time between moves, in seconds.bob.delay = 0.01ought
to get him moving.
</code></pre>
<ol start="5">
<li>Make a more general version ofcirclecalledarcthat takes an additional parameter<br>
angle, which determines what fraction of a circle to draw.angleis in units of degrees,<br>
so whenangle=360,arcshould draw a complete circle.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="encapsulation">4.4 Encapsulation</h3>
<p>The first exercise asks you to put your square-drawing code into a function definition and<br>
then call the function, passing the turtle as a parameter. Here is a solution:</p>
<p>def square(t):<br>
for i in range(4):<br>
fd(t, 100)<br>
lt(t)</p>
<p>square(bob)</p>
<p>The innermost statements,fdandltare indented twice to show that they are inside the<br>
forloop, which is inside the function definition. The next line,square(bob), is flush with<br>
the left margin, so that is the end of both theforloop and the function definition.</p>
<p>Inside the function,trefers to the same turtlebobrefers to, solt(t)has the same effect as<br>
lt(bob). So why not call the parameterbob? The idea is thattcan be any turtle, not just<br>
bob, so you could create a second turtle and pass it as an argument tosquare:</p>
<p>ray = Turtle()<br>
square(ray)</p>
<p>Wrapping a piece of code up in a function is called <strong>encapsulation</strong>. One of the benefits of<br>
encapsulation is that it attaches a name to the code, which serves as a kind of documenta-<br>
tion. Another advantage is that if you re-use the code, it is more concise to call a function<br>
twice than to copy and paste the body!</p>
<h3 id="generalization">4.5 Generalization</h3>
<p>The next step is to add alengthparameter tosquare. Here is a solution:</p>
<p>def square(t, length):<br>
for i in range(4):<br>
fd(t, length)<br>
lt(t)</p>
<p>square(bob, 100)</p>
<p>Adding a parameter to a function is called <strong>generalization</strong> because it makes the function<br>
more general: in the previous version, the square is always the same size; in this version it<br>
can be any size.</p>
<p><strong>4.6. Interface design 35</strong></p>
<p>The next step is also a generalization. Instead of drawing squares,polygondraws regular<br>
polygons with any number of sides. Here is a solution :rule</p>
<p>def polygon(t, n, length):<br>
angle = 360.0 / n<br>
for i in range(n):<br>
fd(t, length)<br>
lt(t, angle)</p>
<p>polygon(bob, 7, 70)</p>
<p>This draws a 7-sided polygon with side length 70. If you have more than a few numeric<br>
arguments, it is easy to forget what they are, or what order they should be in. It is legal,<br>
and sometimes helpful, to include the names of the parameters in the argument list:</p>
<p>polygon(bob, n=7, length=70)</p>
<p>These are called <strong>keyword arguments</strong> because they include the parameter names as “key-<br>
words” (not to be confused with Python keywords likewhileanddef).</p>
<p>This syntax makes the program more readable. It is also a reminder about how arguments<br>
and parameters work: when you call a function, the arguments are assigned to the param-<br>
eters.</p>
<h3 id="interface-design">4.6 Interface design</h3>
<p>The next step is to writecircle, which takes a radius,r, as a parameter. Here is a simple<br>
solution that usespolygonto draw a 50-sided polygon:</p>
<p>def circle(t, r):<br>
circumference = 2 * math.pi * r<br>
n = 50<br>
length = circumference / n<br>
polygon(t, n, length)</p>
<p>The first line computes the circumference of a circle with radiusrusing the formula 2 <em>π</em> r.<br>
Since we usemath.pi, we have to importmath. By convention,importstatements are<br>
usually at the beginning of the script.</p>
<p>nis the number of line segments in our approximation of a circle, solengthis the length<br>
of each segment. Thus,polygondraws a 50-sides polygon that approximates a circle with<br>
radiusr.</p>
<p>One limitation of this solution is thatnis a constant, which means that for very big circles,<br>
the line segments are too long, and for small circles, we waste time drawing very small<br>
segments. One solution would be to generalize the function by takingnas a parameter.<br>
This would give the user (whoever callscircle) more control, but the interface would be<br>
less clean.</p>
<p>The <strong>interface</strong> of a function is a summary of how it is used: what are the parameters? What<br>
does the function do? And what is the return value? An interface is “clean” if it is “as<br>
simple as possible, but not simpler. (Einstein)”</p>
<p>In this example,rbelongs in the interface because it specifies the circle to be drawn.nis<br>
less appropriate because it pertains to the details ofhowthe circle should be rendered.</p>
<p><strong>36 Chapter 4. Case study: interface design</strong></p>
<p>Rather than clutter up the interface, it is better to choose an appropriate value ofndepend-<br>
ing oncircumference:</p>
<p>def circle(t, r):<br>
circumference = 2 * math.pi * r<br>
n = int(circumference / 3) + 1<br>
length = circumference / n<br>
polygon(t, n, length)</p>
<p>Now the number of segments is (approximately)circumference/3, so the length of each<br>
segment is (approximately) 3, which is small enough that the circles look good, but big<br>
enough to be efficient, and appropriate for any size circle.</p>
<h3 id="refactoring">4.7 Refactoring</h3>
<p>When I wrotecircle, I was able to re-usepolygonbecause a many-sided polygon is a good<br>
approximation of a circle. Butarcis not as cooperative; we can’t usepolygonorcircleto<br>
draw an arc.</p>
<p>One alternative is to start with a copy ofpolygonand transform it intoarc. The result<br>
might look like this:</p>
<p>def arc(t, r, angle):<br>
arc_length = 2 * math.pi * r * angle / 360<br>
n = int(arc_length / 3) + 1<br>
step_length = arc_length / n<br>
step_angle = float(angle) / n</p>
<pre><code>for i in range(n):
fd(t, step_length)
lt(t, step_angle)
</code></pre>
<p>The second half of this function looks likepolygon, but we can’t re-usepolygonwithout<br>
changing the interface. We could generalizepolygonto take an angle as a third argument,<br>
but thenpolygonwould no longer be an appropriate name! Instead, let’s call the more<br>
general functionpolyline:</p>
<p>def polyline(t, n, length, angle):<br>
for i in range(n):<br>
fd(t, length)<br>
lt(t, angle)</p>
<p>Now we can rewritepolygonandarcto usepolyline:</p>
<p>def polygon(t, n, length):<br>
angle = 360.0 / n<br>
polyline(t, n, length, angle)</p>
<p>def arc(t, r, angle):<br>
arc_length = 2 * math.pi * r * angle / 360<br>
n = int(arc_length / 3) + 1<br>
step_length = arc_length / n<br>
step_angle = float(angle) / n<br>
polyline(t, n, step_length, step_angle)</p>
<p><strong>4.8. A development plan 37</strong></p>
<p>Finally, we can rewritecircleto usearc:</p>
<p>def circle(t, r):<br>
arc(t, r, 360)</p>
<p>This process—rearranging a program to improve function interfaces and facilitate code re-<br>
use—is called <strong>refactoring</strong>. In this case, we noticed that there was similar code inarcand<br>
polygon, so we “factored it out” intopolyline.</p>
<p>If we had planned ahead, we might have writtenpolylinefirst and avoided refactoring,<br>
but often you don’t know enough at the beginning of a project to design all the interfaces.<br>
Once you start coding, you understand the problem better. Sometimes refactoring is a sign<br>
that you have learned something.</p>
<h3 id="a-development-plan">4.8 A development plan</h3>
<p>A <strong>development plan</strong> is a process for writing programs. The process we used in this case<br>
study is “encapsulation and generalization.” The steps of this process are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Start by writing a small program with no function definitions.</li>
<li>Once you get the program working, encapsulate it in a function and give it a name.</li>
<li>Generalize the function by adding appropriate parameters.</li>
<li>Repeat steps 1–3 until you have a set of working functions. Copy and paste working<br>
code to avoid retyping (and re-debugging).</li>
<li>Look for opportunities to improve the program by refactoring. For example, if you<br>
have similar code in several places, consider factoring it into an appropriately general<br>
function.</li>
</ol>
<p>This process has some drawbacks—we will see alternatives later—but it can be useful if<br>
you don’t know ahead of time how to divide the program into functions. This approach<br>
lets you design as you go along.</p>
<h3 id="docstring">4.9 docstring</h3>
<p>A <strong>docstring</strong> is a string at the beginning of a function that explains the interface (“doc” is<br>
short for “documentation”). Here is an example:</p>
<p>def polyline(t, n, length, angle):<br>
“”“Draws n line segments with the given length and<br>
angle (in degrees) between them. t is a turtle.<br>
“””<br>
for i in range(n):<br>
fd(t, length)<br>
lt(t, angle)</p>
<p><strong>38 Chapter 4. Case study: interface design</strong></p>
<p>This docstring is a triple-quoted string, also known as a multiline string because the triple<br>
quotes allow the string to span more than one line.</p>
<p>It is terse, but it contains the essential information someone would need to use this func-<br>
tion. It explains concisely what the function does (without getting into the details of how<br>
it does it). It explains what effect each parameter has on the behavior of the function and<br>
what type each parameter should be (if it is not obvious).</p>
<p>Writing this kind of documentation is an important part of interface design. A well-<br>
designed interface should be simple to explain; if you are having a hard time explaining<br>
one of your functions, that might be a sign that the interface could be improved.</p>
<h3 id="debugging-3">4.10 Debugging</h3>
<p>An interface is like a contract between a function and a caller. The caller agrees to provide<br>
certain parameters and the function agrees to do certain work.</p>
<p>For example,polylinerequires four arguments:thas to be a Turtle;nis the number of<br>
line segments, so it has to be an integer;lengthshould be a positive number; andangle<br>
has to be a number, which is understood to be in degrees.</p>
<p>These requirements are called <strong>preconditions</strong> because they are supposed to be true before<br>
the function starts executing. Conversely, conditions at the end of the function are <strong>post-<br>
conditions</strong>. Postconditions include the intended effect of the function (like drawing line<br>
segments) and any side effects (like moving the Turtle or making other changes in the<br>
World).</p>
<p>Preconditions are the responsibility of the caller. If the caller violates a (properly docu-<br>
mented!) precondition and the function doesn’t work correctly, the bug is in the caller, not<br>
the function.</p>

<h1 id="conditionals-and-recursion">Conditionals and recursion</h1>
<h3 id="modulus-operator">5.1 Modulus operator</h3>
<p>The <strong>modulus operator</strong> works on integers and yields the remainder when the first operand<br>
is divided by the second. In Python, the modulus operator is a percent sign (%). The syntax<br>
is the same as for other operators:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>quotient = 7 / 3<br>
print quotient<br>
2</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>remainder = 7 % 3<br>
print remainder<br>
1</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>So 7 divided by 3 is 2 with 1 left over.</p>
<p>The modulus operator turns out to be surprisingly useful. For example, you can check<br>
whether one number is divisible by another—ifx % yis zero, thenxis divisible byy.</p>
<p>Also, you can extract the right-most digit or digits from a number. For example,x % 10<br>
yields the right-most digit ofx(in base 10). Similarlyx % 100yields the last two digits.</p>
<h3 id="boolean-expressions">5.2 Boolean expressions</h3>
<p>A <strong>boolean expression</strong> is an expression that is either true or false. The following examples<br>
use the operator==, which compares two operands and producesTrueif they are equal<br>
andFalseotherwise:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>5 == 5<br>
True</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>5 == 6<br>
False</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>TrueandFalseare special values that belong to the typebool; they are not strings:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>type(True)<br>
&lt;type’bool’&gt;</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>type(False)<br>
&lt;type’bool’&gt;</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>42 Chapter 5. Conditionals and recursion</strong></p>
<p>The==operator is one of the <strong>relational operators</strong> ; the others are:</p>
<pre><code>x != y # x is not equal to y
x &gt; y # x is greater than y
x &lt; y # x is less than y
x &gt;= y # x is greater than or equal to y
x &lt;= y # x is less than or equal to y
</code></pre>
<p>Although these operations are probably familiar to you, the Python symbols are different<br>
from the mathematical symbols. A common error is to use a single equal sign (=) instead of<br>
a double equal sign (<mark>). Remember that=is an assignment operator and</mark>is a relational<br>
operator. There is no such thing as=&lt;or=&gt;.</p>
<h3 id="logical-operators">5.3 Logical operators</h3>
<p>There are three <strong>logical operators</strong> : and,or, andnot. The semantics (meaning) of these<br>
operators is similar to their meaning in English. For example,x &gt; 0 and x &lt; 10is true<br>
only ifxis greater than 0andless than 10.</p>
<p>n%2 == 0 or n%3 == 0is true ifeitherof the conditions is true, that is, if the number is<br>
divisible by 2or3.</p>
<p>Finally, thenotoperator negates a boolean expression, sonot (x &gt; y)is true ifx &gt; yis<br>
false, that is, ifxis less than or equal toy.</p>
<p>Strictly speaking, the operands of the logical operators should be boolean expressions, but<br>
Python is not very strict. Any nonzero number is interpreted as “true.”</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>17 and True<br>
True</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>This flexibility can be useful, but there are some subtleties to it that might be confusing.<br>
You might want to avoid it (unless you know what you are doing).</p>
<h3 id="conditional-execution">5.4 Conditional execution</h3>
<p>In order to write useful programs, we almost always need the ability to check conditions<br>
and change the behavior of the program accordingly. <strong>Conditional statements</strong> give us this<br>
ability. The simplest form is theifstatement:</p>
<p>if x &gt; 0:<br>
print ‘x is positive’</p>
<p>The boolean expression afterifis called the <strong>condition</strong>. If it is true, then the indented<br>
statement gets executed. If not, nothing happens.</p>
<p>ifstatements have the same structure as function definitions: a header followed by an<br>
indented body. Statements like this are called <strong>compound statements</strong>.</p>
<p>There is no limit on the number of statements that can appear in the body, but there has to<br>
be at least one. Occasionally, it is useful to have a body with no statements (usually as a<br>
place keeper for code you haven’t written yet). In that case, you can use thepassstatement,<br>
which does nothing.</p>
<p>if x &lt; 0:<br>
pass # need to handle negative values!</p>
<p><strong>5.5. Alternative execution 43</strong></p>
<h3 id="alternative-execution">5.5 Alternative execution</h3>
<p>A second form of theifstatement is <strong>alternative execution</strong> , in which there are two possi-<br>
bilities and the condition determines which one gets executed. The syntax looks like this:</p>
<p>if x%2 == 0:<br>
print’x is even’<br>
else:<br>
print’x is odd’</p>
<p>If the remainder whenxis divided by 2 is 0, then we know thatxis even, and the program<br>
displays a message to that effect. If the condition is false, the second set of statements is<br>
executed. Since the condition must be true or false, exactly one of the alternatives will be<br>
executed. The alternatives are called <strong>branches</strong> , because they are branches in the flow of<br>
execution.</p>
<h3 id="chained-conditionals">5.6 Chained conditionals</h3>
<p>Sometimes there are more than two possibilities and we need more than two branches.<br>
One way to express a computation like that is a <strong>chained conditional</strong> :</p>
<p>if x &lt; y:<br>
print’x is less than y’<br>
elif x &gt; y:<br>
print’x is greater than y’<br>
else:<br>
print’x and y are equal’</p>
<p>elifis an abbreviation of “else if.” Again, exactly one branch will be executed. There is no<br>
limit on the number ofelifstatements. If there is anelseclause, it has to be at the end,<br>
but there doesn’t have to be one.</p>
<p>if choice ==‘a’:<br>
draw_a()<br>
elif choice ==‘b’:<br>
draw_b()<br>
elif choice ==‘c’:<br>
draw_c()</p>
<p>Each condition is checked in order. If the first is false, the next is checked, and so on. If one<br>
of them is true, the corresponding branch executes, and the statement ends. Even if more<br>
than one condition is true, only the first true branch executes.</p>
<h3 id="nested-conditionals">5.7 Nested conditionals</h3>
<p>One conditional can also be nested within another. We could have written the trichotomy<br>
example like this:</p>
<p>if x == y:<br>
print’x and y are equal’<br>
else:<br>
if x &lt; y:</p>
<p><strong>44 Chapter 5. Conditionals and recursion</strong></p>
<pre><code>print 'x is less than y'
else:
print 'x is greater than y'
</code></pre>
<p>The outer conditional contains two branches. The first branch contains a simple statement.<br>
The second branch contains anotherifstatement, which has two branches of its own.<br>
Those two branches are both simple statements, although they could have been conditional<br>
statements as well.</p>
<p>Although the indentation of the statements makes the structure apparent, <strong>nested condi-<br>
tionals</strong> become difficult to read very quickly. In general, it is a good idea to avoid them<br>
when you can.</p>
<p>Logical operators often provide a way to simplify nested conditional statements. For ex-<br>
ample, we can rewrite the following code using a single conditional:</p>
<p>if 0 &lt; x:<br>
if x &lt; 10:<br>
print ‘x is a positive single-digit number.’</p>
<p>Theprintstatement is executed only if we make it past both conditionals, so we can get<br>
the same effect with theandoperator:</p>
<p>if 0 &lt; x and x &lt; 10:<br>
print ‘x is a positive single-digit number.’</p>
<h3 id="recursion">5.8 Recursion</h3>
<p>It is legal for one function to call another; it is also legal for a function to call itself. It may<br>
not be obvious why that is a good thing, but it turns out to be one of the most magical<br>
things a program can do. For example, look at the following function:</p>
<p>def countdown(n):<br>
if n &lt;= 0:<br>
print ‘Blastoff!’<br>
else:<br>
print n<br>
countdown(n-1)</p>
<p>Ifnis 0 or negative, it outputs the word, “Blastoff!” Otherwise, it outputsnand then calls<br>
a function namedcountdown—itself—passingn-1as an argument.</p>
<p>What happens if we call this function like this?</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>countdown(3)</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The execution ofcountdownbegins withn=3, and sincenis greater than 0, it outputs the<br>
value 3, and then calls itself…</p>
<pre><code>The execution ofcountdownbegins withn=2, and sincenis greater than 0, it
outputs the value 2, and then calls itself...
The execution ofcountdownbegins withn=1, and sincenis greater
than 0, it outputs the value 1, and then calls itself...
The execution ofcountdownbegins withn=0, and sincenis
not greater than 0, it outputs the word, “Blastoff!” and then
returns.
</code></pre>
<p><strong>5.9. Stack diagrams for recursive functions 45</strong></p>
<pre><code>Thecountdownthat gotn=1returns.
Thecountdownthat gotn=2returns.
</code></pre>
<p>Thecountdownthat gotn=3returns.</p>
<p>And then you’re back in__main__. So, the total output looks like this:</p>
<p>3<br>
2<br>
1<br>
Blastoff!</p>
<p>A function that calls itself is <strong>recursive</strong> ; the process is called <strong>recursion</strong>.</p>
<p>As another example, we can write a function that prints a stringntimes.</p>
<p>def print_n(s, n):<br>
if n &lt;= 0:<br>
return<br>
print s<br>
print_n(s, n-1)</p>
<p>Ifn &lt;= 0thereturnstatement exits the function. The flow of execution immediately re-<br>
turns to the caller, and the remaining lines of the function are not executed.</p>
<p>The rest of the function is similar tocountdown: ifnis greater than 0, it displayssand then<br>
calls itself to displaysn−1 additional times. So the number of lines of output is1 + (n -<br>
1), which adds up ton.</p>
<p>For simple examples like this, it is probably easier to use aforloop. But we will see<br>
examples later that are hard to write with aforloop and easy to write with recursion, so it<br>
is good to start early.</p>
<h3 id="stack-diagrams-for-recursive-functions">5.9 Stack diagrams for recursive functions</h3>
<p>In Section 3.10, we used a stack diagram to represent the state of a program during a func-<br>
tion call. The same kind of diagram can help interpret a recursive function.</p>
<p>Every time a function gets called, Python creates a new function frame, which contains the<br>
function’s local variables and parameters. For a recursive function, there might be more<br>
than one frame on the stack at the same time.</p>
<p>Figure 5.1 shows a stack diagram forcountdowncalled withn = 3.</p>
<p>As usual, the top of the stack is the frame for__main__. It is empty because we did not<br>
create any variables in__main__or pass any arguments to it.</p>
<p>The fourcountdownframes have different values for the parametern. The bottom of the<br>
stack, wheren=0, is called the <strong>base case</strong>. It does not make a recursive call, so there are no<br>
more frames.<br>
<strong>Exercise 5.1.</strong> Draw a stack diagram forprint_ncalled withs ='Hello’andn=2.<br>
<strong>Exercise 5.2.</strong> Write a function calleddo_nthat takes a function object and a number,n, as argu-<br>

<h3 id="infinite-recursion">5.10 Infinite recursion</h3>
<p>If a recursion never reaches a base case, it goes on making recursive calls forever, and the<br>
program never terminates. This is known as <strong>infinite recursion</strong> , and it is generally not a<br>
good idea. Here is a minimal program with an infinite recursion:</p>
<p>def recurse():<br>
recurse()</p>
<p>In most programming environments, a program with infinite recursion does not really run<br>
forever. Python reports an error message when the maximum recursion depth is reached:</p>
<pre><code>File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 2, in recurse
File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 2, in recurse
File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 2, in recurse
</code></pre>
<p>File “”, line 2, in recurse<br>
RuntimeError: Maximum recursion depth exceeded</p>
<p>This traceback is a little bigger than the one we saw in the previous chapter. When the error<br>
occurs, there are 1000recurseframes on the stack!</p>
<h3 id="keyboard-input">5.11 Keyboard input</h3>
<p>The programs we have written so far are a bit rude in the sense that they accept no input<br>
from the user. They just do the same thing every time.</p>
<p>Python 2 provides a built-in function calledraw_inputthat gets input from the keyboard.<br>
In Python 3, it is calledinput. When this function is called, the program stops and waits for<br>
the user to type something. When the user pressesReturnorEnter, the program resumes<br>
andraw_inputreturns what the user typed as a string.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>text = raw_input()<br>
What are you waiting for?</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>print text<br>
What are you waiting for?</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>5.12. Debugging 47</strong></p>
<p>Before getting input from the user, it is a good idea to print a prompt telling the user what<br>
to input.raw_inputcan take a prompt as an argument:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>name = raw_input(‘What…is your name?\n’)<br>
What…is your name?<br>
Arthur, King of the Britons!</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>print name<br>
Arthur, King of the Britons!</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The sequence\nat the end of the prompt represents a <strong>newline</strong> , which is a special character<br>
that causes a line break. That’s why the user’s input appears below the prompt.</p>
<p>If you expect the user to type an integer, you can try to convert the return value toint:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>prompt =‘What…is the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow?\n’<br>
speed = raw_input(prompt)<br>
What…is the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow?<br>
17</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>int(speed)<br>
17</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>But if the user types something other than a string of digits, you get an error:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>speed = raw_input(prompt)<br>
What…is the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow?<br>
What do you mean, an African or a European swallow?</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>int(speed)<br>
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>We will see how to handle this kind of error later.</p>
<h3 id="debugging-4">5.12 Debugging</h3>
<p>The traceback Python displays when an error occurs contains a lot of information, but it<br>
can be overwhelming, especially when there are many frames on the stack. The most useful<br>
parts are usually:</p>
<ul>
<li>What kind of error it was, and</li>
<li>Where it occurred.</li>
</ul>
<p>Syntax errors are usually easy to find, but there are a few gotchas. Whitespace errors can<br>
be tricky because spaces and tabs are invisible and we are used to ignoring them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>x = 5<br>
y = 6<br>
File “”, line 1<br>
y = 6<br>
^<br>
IndentationError: unexpected indent</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>In this example, the problem is that the second line is indented by one space. But the error<br>
message points toy, which is misleading. In general, error messages indicate where the<br>
problem was discovered, but the actual error might be earlier in the code, sometimes on a<br>
previous line.</p>
<p><strong>48 Chapter 5. Conditionals and recursion</strong></p>
<p>The same is true of runtime errors.</p>
<p>Suppose you are trying to compute a signal-to-noise ratio in decibels. The formula is<br>
SN Rdb=10 log 10 (Psignal/Pnoise). In Python, you might write something like this:</p>
<p>import math<br>
signal_power = 9<br>
noise_power = 10<br>
ratio = signal_power / noise_power<br>
decibels = 10 * math.log10(ratio)<br>
print decibels</p>
<p>But when you run it in Python 2, you get an error message.</p>
<p>Traceback (most recent call last):<br>
File “<a href="http://snr.py">snr.py</a>”, line 5, in?<br>
decibels = 10 * math.log10(ratio)<br>
ValueError: math domain error</p>
<p>The error message indicates line 5, but there is nothing wrong with that line. To find the<br>
real error, it might be useful to print the value ofratio, which turns out to be 0. The<br>
problem is in line 4, because dividing two integers does floor division. The solution is to<br>
represent signal power and noise power with floating-point values.</p>
<p>In general, error messages tell you where the problem was discovered, but that is often not<br>
where it was caused.</p>
<p>In Python 3, this example does not cause an error; the division operator performs floating-<br>
point division even with integer operands.</p>

<h1 id="fruitful-functions">Fruitful functions</h1>
<h3 id="return-values">6.1 Return values</h3>
<p>Some of the built-in functions we have used, such as the math functions, produce results.<br>
Calling the function generates a value, which we usually assign to a variable or use as part<br>
of an expression.</p>
<p>e = math.exp(1.0)<br>
height = radius * math.sin(radians)</p>
<p>All of the functions we have written so far are void; they print something or move turtles<br>
around, but their return value isNone.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we are (finally) going to write fruitful functions. The first example isarea,<br>
which returns the area of a circle with the given radius:</p>
<p>def area(radius):<br>
temp = math.pi * radius**2<br>
return temp</p>
<p>We have seen thereturnstatement before, but in a fruitful function thereturnstatement<br>
includes an expression. This statement means: “Return immediately from this function<br>
and use the following expression as a return value.” The expression can be arbitrarily<br>
complicated, so we could have written this function more concisely:</p>
<p>def area(radius):<br>
return math.pi * radius**2</p>
<p>On the other hand, <strong>temporary variables</strong> liketempoften make debugging easier.</p>
<p>Sometimes it is useful to have multiple return statements, one in each branch of a condi-<br>
tional:</p>
<p>def absolute_value(x):<br>
if x &lt; 0:<br>
return -x<br>
else:<br>
return x</p>
<p><strong>52 Chapter 6. Fruitful functions</strong></p>
<p>Since thesereturnstatements are in an alternative conditional, only one will be executed.</p>
<p>As soon as a return statement executes, the function terminates without executing any<br>
subsequent statements. Code that appears after areturnstatement, or any other place the<br>
flow of execution can never reach, is called <strong>dead code</strong>.</p>
<p>In a fruitful function, it is a good idea to ensure that every possible path through the pro-<br>
gram hits areturnstatement. For example:</p>
<p>def absolute_value(x):<br>
if x &lt; 0:<br>
return -x<br>
if x &gt; 0:<br>
return x</p>
<p>This function is incorrect because ifxhappens to be 0, neither condition is true, and the<br>
function ends without hitting areturnstatement. If the flow of execution gets to the end<br>
of a function, the return value isNone, which is not the absolute value of 0.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>print absolute_value(0)<br>
None</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>By the way, Python provides a built-in function calledabsthat computes absolute values.<br>
<strong>Exercise 6.1.</strong> Write acomparefunction that returns 1 ifx &gt; y, 0 ifx == y, and-1ifx &lt; y.</p>
<h3 id="incremental-development">6.2 Incremental development</h3>
<p>As you write larger functions, you might find yourself spending more time debugging.</p>
<p>To deal with increasingly complex programs, you might want to try a process called <strong>in-<br>
cremental development</strong>. The goal of incremental development is to avoid long debugging<br>
sessions by adding and testing only a small amount of code at a time.</p>
<p>As an example, suppose you want to find the distance between two points, given by the<br>
coordinates(x 1 ,y 1 )and(x 2 ,y 2 ). By the Pythagorean theorem, the distance is:</p>
<pre><code>distance=
</code></pre>
<h4 id="√">√</h4>
<pre><code>(x 2 −x 1 )^2 + (y 2 −y 1 )^2
</code></pre>
<p>The first step is to consider what adistancefunction should look like in Python. In other<br>
words, what are the inputs (parameters) and what is the output (return value)?</p>
<p>In this case, the inputs are two points, which you can represent using four numbers. The<br>
return value is the distance, which is a floating-point value.</p>
<p>Already you can write an outline of the function:</p>
<p>def distance(x1, y1, x2, y2):<br>
return 0.0</p>
<p>Obviously, this version doesn’t compute distances; it always returns zero. But it is syn-<br>
tactically correct, and it runs, which means that you can test it before you make it more<br>
complicated.</p>
<p>To test the new function, call it with sample arguments:</p>
<p><strong>6.2. Incremental development 53</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>distance(1, 2, 4, 6)<br>
0.0</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>I chose these values so that the horizontal distance is 3 and the vertical distance is 4; that<br>
way, the result is 5 (the hypotenuse of a 3-4-5 triangle). When testing a function, it is useful<br>
to know the right answer.</p>
<p>At this point we have confirmed that the function is syntactically correct, and we can start<br>
adding code to the body. A reasonable next step is to find the differencesx 2 −x 1 and<br>
y 2 −y 1. The next version stores those values in temporary variables and prints them.</p>
<p>def distance(x1, y1, x2, y2):<br>
dx = x2 - x1<br>
dy = y2 - y1<br>
print’dx is’, dx<br>
print’dy is’, dy<br>
return 0.0</p>
<p>If the function is working, it should display’dx is 3’and’dy is 4’. If so, we know that<br>
the function is getting the right arguments and performing the first computation correctly.<br>
If not, there are only a few lines to check.</p>
<p>Next we compute the sum of squares ofdxanddy:</p>
<p>def distance(x1, y1, x2, y2):<br>
dx = x2 - x1<br>
dy = y2 - y1<br>
dsquared = dx<strong>2 + dy</strong>2<br>
print’dsquared is:’, dsquared<br>
return 0.0</p>
<p>Again, you would run the program at this stage and check the output (which should be<br>
25). Finally, you can usemath.sqrtto compute and return the result:</p>
<p>def distance(x1, y1, x2, y2):<br>
dx = x2 - x1<br>
dy = y2 - y1<br>
dsquared = dx<strong>2 + dy</strong>2<br>
result = math.sqrt(dsquared)<br>
return result</p>
<p>If that works correctly, you are done. Otherwise, you might want to print the value of<br>
resultbefore the return statement.</p>
<p>The final version of the function doesn’t display anything when it runs; it only returns<br>
a value. Theprintstatements we wrote are useful for debugging, but once you get the<br>
function working, you should remove them. Code like that is called <strong>scaffolding</strong> because it<br>
is helpful for building the program but is not part of the final product.</p>
<p>When you start out, you should add only a line or two of code at a time. As you gain more<br>
experience, you might find yourself writing and debugging bigger chunks. Either way,<br>
incremental development can save you a lot of debugging time.</p>
<p>The key aspects of the process are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Start with a working program and make small incremental changes. At any point, if<br>
there is an error, you should have a good idea where it is.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>54 Chapter 6. Fruitful functions</strong></p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Use temporary variables to hold intermediate values so you can display and check<br>
them.</li>
<li>Once the program is working, you might want to remove some of the scaffolding or<br>
consolidate multiple statements into compound expressions, but only if it does not<br>
make the program difficult to read.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Exercise 6.2.</strong> Use incremental development to write a function calledhypotenusethat returns the<br>
length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle given the lengths of the two legs as arguments. Record<br>
each stage of the development process as you go.</p>
<h3 id="composition-1">6.3 Composition</h3>
<p>As you should expect by now, you can call one function from within another. This ability<br>
is called <strong>composition</strong>.</p>
<p>As an example, we’ll write a function that takes two points, the center of the circle and a<br>
point on the perimeter, and computes the area of the circle.</p>
<p>Assume that the center point is stored in the variablesxcandyc, and the perimeter point is<br>
inxpandyp. The first step is to find the radius of the circle, which is the distance between<br>
the two points. We just wrote a function,distance, that does that:</p>
<p>radius = distance(xc, yc, xp, yp)</p>
<p>The next step is to find the area of a circle with that radius; we just wrote that, too:</p>
<p>result = area(radius)</p>
<p>Encapsulating these steps in a function, we get:</p>
<p>def circle_area(xc, yc, xp, yp):<br>
radius = distance(xc, yc, xp, yp)<br>
result = area(radius)<br>
return result</p>
<p>The temporary variablesradiusandresultare useful for development and debugging,<br>
but once the program is working, we can make it more concise by composing the function<br>
calls:</p>
<p>def circle_area(xc, yc, xp, yp):<br>
return area(distance(xc, yc, xp, yp))</p>
<h3 id="boolean-functions">6.4 Boolean functions</h3>
<p>Functions can return booleans, which is often convenient for hiding complicated tests in-<br>
side functions. For example:</p>

<p><strong>6.5. More recursion 55</strong></p>
<p>It is common to give boolean functions names that sound like yes/no questions;<br>
is_divisiblereturns eitherTrueorFalseto indicate whetherxis divisible byy.</p>
<p>Here is an example:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>is_divisible(6, 4)<br>
False</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>is_divisible(6, 3)<br>
True</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The result of the==operator is a boolean, so we can write the function more concisely by<br>
returning it directly:</p>
<p>def is_divisible(x, y):<br>
return x % y == 0</p>
<p>Boolean functions are often used in conditional statements:</p>
<p>if is_divisible(x, y):<br>
print’x is divisible by y’</p>
<p>It might be tempting to write something like:</p>
<p>if is_divisible(x, y) == True:<br>
print’x is divisible by y’</p>
<p>But the extra comparison is unnecessary.<br>

<h3 id="more-recursion">6.5 More recursion</h3>
<p>We have only covered a small subset of Python, but you might be interested to know that<br>
this subset is acompleteprogramming language, which means that anything that can be<br>
computed can be expressed in this language. Any program ever written could be rewritten<br>
using only the language features you have learned so far (actually, you would need a few<br>
commands to control devices like the keyboard, mouse, disks, etc., but that’s all).</p>
<p>Proving that claim is a nontrivial exercise first accomplished by Alan Turing, one of the<br>
first computer scientists (some would argue that he was a mathematician, but a lot of early<br>
computer scientists started as mathematicians). Accordingly, it is known as the Turing<br>
Thesis. For a more complete (and accurate) discussion of the Turing Thesis, I recommend<br>
Michael Sipser’s bookIntroduction to the Theory of Computation.</p>
<p>To give you an idea of what you can do with the tools you have learned so far, we’ll eval-<br>
uate a few recursively defined mathematical functions. A recursive definition is similar to<br>
a circular definition, in the sense that the definition contains a reference to the thing being<br>
defined. A truly circular definition is not very useful:</p>
<p><strong>vorpal:</strong> An adjective used to describe something that is vorpal.</p>
<p>If you saw that definition in the dictionary, you might be annoyed. On the other hand,<br>
if you looked up the definition of the factorial function, denoted with the symbol !, you<br>
might get something like this:</p>
<pre><code>0!= 1
n!=n(n− 1 )!
</code></pre>
<p><strong>56 Chapter 6. Fruitful functions</strong></p>
<p>This definition says that the factorial of 0 is 1, and the factorial of any other value,n, isn<br>
multiplied by the factorial ofn−1.</p>
<p>So 3! is 3 times 2!, which is 2 times 1!, which is 1 times 0!. Putting it all together, 3! equals 3<br>
times 2 times 1 times 1, which is 6.</p>
<p>If you can write a recursive definition of something, you can usually write a Python pro-<br>
gram to evaluate it. The first step is to decide what the parameters should be. In this case<br>
it should be clear thatfactorialtakes an integer:</p>
<p>def factorial(n):</p>
<p>If the argument happens to be 0, all we have to do is return 1:</p>
<p>def factorial(n):<br>
if n == 0:<br>
return 1</p>
<p>Otherwise, and this is the interesting part, we have to make a recursive call to find the<br>
factorial ofn−1 and then multiply it byn:</p>
<p>def factorial(n):<br>
if n == 0:<br>
return 1<br>
else:<br>
recurse = factorial(n-1)<br>
result = n * recurse<br>
return result</p>
<p>The flow of execution for this program is similar to the flow ofcountdownin Section 5.8. If<br>
we callfactorialwith the value 3:</p>
<p>Since 3 is not 0, we take the second branch and calculate the factorial ofn-1…</p>
<pre><code>Since 2 is not 0, we take the second branch and calculate the factorial ofn-1...
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Since 1 is not 0, we take the second branch and calculate the factorial
ofn-1...
Since 0is0, we take the first branch and return 1 without
making any more recursive calls.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>The return value (1) is multiplied byn, which is 1, and the result is
returned.
The return value (1) is multiplied byn, which is 2, and the result is returned.
</code></pre>
<p>The return value (2) is multiplied byn, which is 3, and the result, 6, becomes the return<br>
value of the function call that started the whole process.</p>
<p>Figure 6.1 shows what the stack diagram looks like for this sequence of function calls.</p>
<p>The return values are shown being passed back up the stack. In each frame, the return<br>
value is the value ofresult, which is the product ofnandrecurse.</p>
<p>In the last frame, the local variablesrecurseandresultdo not exist, because the branch<br>
that creates them does not execute.</p>

<h3 id="leap-of-faith">6.6 Leap of faith</h3>
<p>Following the flow of execution is one way to read programs, but it can quickly become<br>
labyrinthine. An alternative is what I call the “leap of faith.” When you come to a function<br>
call, instead of following the flow of execution, youassumethat the function works correctly<br>
and returns the right result.</p>
<p>In fact, you are already practicing this leap of faith when you use built-in functions. When<br>
you callmath.cosormath.exp, you don’t examine the bodies of those functions. You just<br>
assume that they work because the people who wrote the built-in functions were good<br>
programmers.</p>
<p>The same is true when you call one of your own functions. For example, in Section 6.4, we<br>
wrote a function calledis_divisiblethat determines whether one number is divisible by<br>
another. Once we have convinced ourselves that this function is correct—by examining the<br>
code and testing—we can use the function without looking at the body again.</p>
<p>The same is true of recursive programs. When you get to the recursive call, instead of<br>
following the flow of execution, you should assume that the recursive call works (yields<br>
the correct result) and then ask yourself, “Assuming that I can find the factorial ofn−1,<br>
can I compute the factorial ofn?” In this case, it is clear that you can, by multiplying byn.</p>
<p>Of course, it’s a bit strange to assume that the function works correctly when you haven’t<br>
finished writing it, but that’s why it’s called a leap of faith!</p>
<h3 id="one-more-example">6.7 One more example</h3>
<p>Afterfactorial, the most common example of a recursively defined mathematical func-<br>
tion isfibonacci, which has the following definition (seehttp://en.wikipedia.org/<br>
wiki/Fibonacci_number):</p>
<pre><code>fibonacci( 0 ) = 0
fibonacci( 1 ) = 1
fibonacci(n) =fibonacci(n− 1 ) +fibonacci(n− 2 )
</code></pre>
<p>Translated into Python, it looks like this:</p>
<p><strong>58 Chapter 6. Fruitful functions</strong></p>
<p>def fibonacci (n):<br>
if n == 0:<br>
return 0<br>
elif n == 1:<br>
return 1<br>
else:<br>
return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)</p>
<p>If you try to follow the flow of execution here, even for fairly small values ofn, your head<br>
explodes. But according to the leap of faith, if you assume that the two recursive calls work<br>
correctly, then it is clear that you get the right result by adding them together.</p>
<h3 id="checking-types">6.8 Checking types</h3>
<p>What happens if we callfactorialand give it 1.5 as an argument?</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>factorial(1.5)<br>
RuntimeError: Maximum recursion depth exceeded</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>It looks like an infinite recursion. But how can that be? There is a base case—whenn == 0.<br>
But ifnis not an integer, we canmissthe base case and recurse forever.</p>
<p>In the first recursive call, the value ofnis 0.5. In the next, it is -0.5. From there, it gets<br>
smaller (more negative), but it will never be 0.</p>
<p>We have two choices. We can try to generalize thefactorialfunction to work with<br>
floating-point numbers, or we can makefactorialcheck the type of its argument. The<br>
first option is called the gamma function and it’s a little beyond the scope of this book. So<br>
we’ll go for the second.</p>
<p>We can use the built-in functionisinstanceto verify the type of the argument. While<br>
we’re at it, we can also make sure the argument is positive:</p>
<p>def factorial (n):<br>
if not isinstance(n, int):<br>
print ‘Factorial is only defined for integers.’<br>
return None<br>
elif n &lt; 0:<br>
print ‘Factorial is not defined for negative integers.’<br>
return None<br>
elif n == 0:<br>
return 1<br>
else:<br>
return n * factorial(n-1)</p>
<p>The first base case handles nonintegers; the second catches negative integers. In both cases,<br>
the program prints an error message and returnsNoneto indicate that something went<br>
wrong:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>factorial(‘fred’)<br>
Factorial is only defined for integers.<br>
None</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>factorial(-2)<br>
Factorial is not defined for negative integers.<br>
None</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>6.9. Debugging 59</strong></p>
<p>If we get past both checks, then we know thatnis positive or zero, so we can prove that<br>
the recursion terminates.</p>
<p>This program demonstrates a pattern sometimes called a <strong>guardian</strong>. The first two condi-<br>
tionals act as guardians, protecting the code that follows from values that might cause an<br>
error. The guardians make it possible to prove the correctness of the code.</p>
<p>In Section 11.3 we will see a more flexible alternative to printing an error message: raising<br>
an exception.</p>
<h3 id="debugging-5">6.9 Debugging</h3>
<p>Breaking a large program into smaller functions creates natural checkpoints for debugging.<br>
If a function is not working, there are three possibilities to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is something wrong with the arguments the function is getting; a precondition<br>
is violated.</li>
<li>There is something wrong with the function; a postcondition is violated.</li>
<li>There is something wrong with the return value or the way it is being used.</li>
</ul>
<p>To rule out the first possibility, you can add aprintstatement at the beginning of the<br>
function and display the values of the parameters (and maybe their types). Or you can<br>
write code that checks the preconditions explicitly.</p>
<p>If the parameters look good, add aprintstatement before eachreturnstatement that dis-<br>
plays the return value. If possible, check the result by hand. Consider calling the function<br>
with values that make it easy to check the result (as in Section 6.2).</p>
<p>If the function seems to be working, look at the function call to make sure the return value<br>
is being used correctly (or used at all!).</p>
<p>Adding print statements at the beginning and end of a function can help make the flow of<br>
execution more visible. For example, here is a version offactorialwith print statements:</p>
<p>def factorial(n):<br>
space =’’* (4 * n)<br>
print space,‘factorial’, n<br>
if n == 0:<br>
print space,‘returning 1’<br>
return 1<br>
else:<br>
recurse = factorial(n-1)<br>
result = n * recurse<br>
print space,‘returning’, result<br>
return result</p>
<p>spaceis a string of space characters that controls the indentation of the output. Here is the<br>
result offactorial(5):</p>

<h1 id="iteration">Iteration</h1>
<h3 id="multiple-assignment">7.1 Multiple assignment</h3>
<p>As you may have discovered, it is legal to make more than one assignment to the same<br>
variable. A new assignment makes an existing variable refer to a new value (and stop<br>
referring to the old value).</p>
<p>bruce = 5<br>
print bruce,<br>
bruce = 7<br>
print bruce</p>
<p>The output of this program is5 7, because the first timebruceis printed, its value is 5,<br>
and the second time, its value is 7. The comma at the end of the firstprintstatement<br>
suppresses the newline, which is why both outputs appear on the same line.</p>
<p>Figure 7.1 shows what <strong>multiple assignment</strong> looks like in a state diagram.</p>
<p>With multiple assignment it is especially important to distinguish between an assignment<br>
operation and a statement of equality. Because Python uses the equal sign (=) for assign-<br>
ment, it is tempting to interpret a statement likea = bas a statement of equality. It is not!</p>
<p>First, equality is a symmetric relation and assignment is not. For example, in mathematics,<br>
ifa=7 then 7=a. But in Python, the statementa = 7is legal and7 = ais not.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in mathematics, a statement of equality is either true or false, for all time. If<br>
a=bnow, thenawill always equalb. In Python, an assignment statement can make two<br>
variables equal, but they don’t have to stay that way:</p>
<p>a = 5<br>
b = a # a and b are now equal<br>
a = 3 # a and b are no longer equal</p>
<p>The third line changes the value ofabut does not change the value ofb, so they are no<br>
longer equal.</p>
<p>Although multiple assignment is frequently helpful, you should use it with caution. If the<br>
values of variables change frequently, it can make the code difficult to read and debug.</p>

<h3 id="updating-variables">7.2 Updating variables</h3>
<p>One of the most common forms of multiple assignment is an <strong>update</strong> , where the new value<br>
of the variable depends on the old.</p>
<p>x = x+1</p>
<p>This means “get the current value ofx, add one, and then updatexwith the new value.”</p>
<p>If you try to update a variable that doesn’t exist, you get an error, because Python evaluates<br>
the right side before it assigns a value tox:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>x = x+1<br>
NameError: name 'x’is not defined</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Before you can update a variable, you have to <strong>initialize</strong> it, usually with a simple assign-<br>
ment:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>x = 0<br>
x = x+1</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Updating a variable by adding 1 is called an <strong>increment</strong> ; subtracting 1 is called a <strong>decrement</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="thewhilestatement">7.3 Thewhilestatement</h3>
<p>Computers are often used to automate repetitive tasks. Repeating identical or similar tasks<br>
without making errors is something that computers do well and people do poorly.</p>
<p>We have seen two programs,countdownandprint_n, that use recursion to perform rep-<br>
etition, which is also called <strong>iteration</strong>. Because iteration is so common, Python provides<br>
several language features to make it easier. One is theforstatement we saw in Section 4.2.<br>
We’ll get back to that later.</p>
<p>Another is thewhilestatement. Here is a version ofcountdownthat uses awhilestatement:</p>
<p>def countdown(n):<br>
while n &gt; 0:<br>
print n<br>
n = n-1<br>
print ‘Blastoff!’</p>
<p>You can almost read thewhilestatement as if it were English. It means, “Whilenis greater<br>
than 0, display the value ofnand then reduce the value ofnby 1. When you get to 0,<br>
display the wordBlastoff!”</p>
<p>More formally, here is the flow of execution for awhilestatement:</p>
<ol>
<li>Evaluate the condition, yieldingTrueorFalse.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>7.4.</strong> break <strong>65</strong></p>
<ol start="2">
<li>If the condition is false, exit thewhilestatement and continue execution at the next<br>
statement.</li>
<li>If the condition is true, execute the body and then go back to step 1.</li>
</ol>
<p>This type of flow is called a <strong>loop</strong> because the third step loops back around to the top.</p>
<p>The body of the loop should change the value of one or more variables so that eventu-<br>
ally the condition becomes false and the loop terminates. Otherwise the loop will repeat<br>
forever, which is called an <strong>infinite loop</strong>. An endless source of amusement for computer<br>
scientists is the observation that the directions on shampoo, “Lather, rinse, repeat,” are an<br>
infinite loop.</p>
<p>In the case ofcountdown, we can prove that the loop terminates because we know that the<br>
value ofnis finite, and we can see that the value ofngets smaller each time through the<br>
loop, so eventually we have to get to 0. In other cases, it is not so easy to tell:</p>
<p>def sequence(n):<br>
while n != 1:<br>
print n,<br>
if n%2 == 0: # n is even<br>
n = n/2<br>
else: # n is odd<br>
n = n*3+1</p>
<p>The condition for this loop isn != 1, so the loop will continue untilnis 1 , which makes<br>
the condition false.</p>
<p>Each time through the loop, the program outputs the value ofnand then checks whether<br>
it is even or odd. If it is even,nis divided by 2. If it is odd, the value ofnis replaced with<br>
n*3+1. For example, if the argument passed tosequenceis 3, the resulting sequence is 3,<br>
10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1.</p>
<p>Sincensometimes increases and sometimes decreases, there is no obvious proof thatnwill<br>
ever reach 1, or that the program terminates. For some particular values ofn, we can prove<br>
termination. For example, if the starting value is a power of two, then the value ofnwill be<br>
even each time through the loop until it reaches 1. The previous example ends with such a<br>
sequence, starting with 16.</p>
<p>The hard question is whether we can prove that this program terminates forall posi-<br>
tive valuesofn. So far, no one has been able to prove itordisprove it! (Seehttp:<br>
<a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture.)">//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture.)</a><br>
<strong>Exercise 7.1.</strong> Rewrite the functionprint_nfrom Section 5.8 using iteration instead of recursion.</p>
<h3 id="break">7.4 break</h3>
<p>Sometimes you don’t know it’s time to end a loop until you get half way through the body.<br>
In that case you can use thebreakstatement to jump out of the loop.</p>
<p>For example, suppose you want to take input from the user until they typedone. You could<br>
write:</p>
<p><strong>66 Chapter 7. Iteration</strong></p>
<p>while True:<br>
line = raw_input(’&gt; ')<br>
if line == ‘done’:<br>
break<br>
print line</p>
<p>print ‘Done!’</p>
<p>The loop condition isTrue, which is always true, so the loop runs until it hits the break<br>
statement.</p>
<p>Each time through, it prompts the user with an angle bracket. If the user typesdone, the<br>
breakstatement exits the loop. Otherwise the program echoes whatever the user types and<br>
goes back to the top of the loop. Here’s a sample run:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>not done<br>
not done<br>
done<br>
Done!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This way of writingwhileloops is common because you can check the condition anywhere<br>
in the loop (not just at the top) and you can express the stop condition affirmatively (“stop<br>
when this happens”) rather than negatively (“keep going until that happens.”).</p>
<h3 id="square-roots">7.5 Square roots</h3>
<p>Loops are often used in programs that compute numerical results by starting with an ap-<br>
proximate answer and iteratively improving it.</p>
<p>For example, one way of computing square roots is Newton’s method. Suppose that you<br>
want to know the square root ofa. If you start with almost any estimate,x, you can com-<br>
pute a better estimate with the following formula:</p>

<h3 id="algorithms">7.6 Algorithms</h3>
<p>Newton’s method is an example of an <strong>algorithm</strong> : it is a mechanical process for solving a<br>
category of problems (in this case, computing square roots).</p>
<p>It is not easy to define an algorithm. It might help to start with something that is not an<br>
algorithm. When you learned to multiply single-digit numbers, you probably memorized<br>
the multiplication table. In effect, you memorized 100 specific solutions. That kind of<br>
knowledge is not algorithmic.</p>
<p><strong>68 Chapter 7. Iteration</strong></p>
<p>But if you were “lazy,” you probably cheated by learning a few tricks. For example, to<br>
find the product ofnand 9, you can writen−1 as the first digit and 10−nas the second<br>
digit. This trick is a general solution for multiplying any single-digit number by 9. That’s<br>
an algorithm!</p>
<p>Similarly, the techniques you learned for addition with carrying, subtraction with borrow-<br>
ing, and long division are all algorithms. One of the characteristics of algorithms is that<br>
they do not require any intelligence to carry out. They are mechanical processes in which<br>
each step follows from the last according to a simple set of rules.</p>
<p>In my opinion, it is embarrassing that humans spend so much time in school learning to<br>
execute algorithms that, quite literally, require no intelligence.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the process of designing algorithms is interesting, intellectually chal-<br>
lenging, and a central part of what we call programming.</p>
<p>Some of the things that people do naturally, without difficulty or conscious thought, are<br>
the hardest to express algorithmically. Understanding natural language is a good example.<br>
We all do it, but so far no one has been able to explainhowwe do it, at least not in the form<br>
of an algorithm.</p>
<h3 id="debugging-6">7.7 Debugging</h3>
<p>As you start writing bigger programs, you might find yourself spending more time debug-<br>
ging. More code means more chances to make an error and more place for bugs to hide.</p>
<p>One way to cut your debugging time is “debugging by bisection.” For example, if there<br>
are 100 lines in your program and you check them one at a time, it would take 100 steps.</p>
<p>Instead, try to break the problem in half. Look at the middle of the program, or near it, for<br>
an intermediate value you can check. Add aprintstatement (or something else that has a<br>
verifiable effect) and run the program.</p>
<p>If the mid-point check is incorrect, there must be a problem in the first half of the program.<br>
If it is correct, the problem is in the second half.</p>
<p>Every time you perform a check like this, you halve the number of lines you have to search.<br>
After six steps (which is fewer than 100), you would be down to one or two lines of code,<br>
at least in theory.</p>
<p>In practice it is not always clear what the “middle of the program” is and not always pos-<br>
sible to check it. It doesn’t make sense to count lines and find the exact midpoint. Instead,<br>
think about places in the program where there might be errors and places where it is easy<br>
to put a check. Then choose a spot where you think the chances are about the same that<br>
the bug is before or after the check.</p>

<h1 id="strings">Strings</h1>
<h3 id="a-string-is-a-sequence">8.1 A string is a sequence</h3>
<p>A string is a <strong>sequence</strong> of characters. You can access the characters one at a time with the<br>
bracket operator:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>fruit =‘banana’<br>
letter = fruit[1]</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The second statement selects character number 1 fromfruitand assigns it toletter.</p>
<p>The expression in brackets is called an <strong>index</strong>. The index indicates which character in the<br>
sequence you want (hence the name).</p>
<p>But you might not get what you expect:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>print letter<br>
a</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>For most people, the first letter of’banana’isb, nota. But for computer scientists, the<br>
index is an offset from the beginning of the string, and the offset of the first letter is zero.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>letter = fruit[0]<br>
print letter<br>
b</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Sobis the 0th letter (“zero-eth”) of’banana’,ais the 1th letter (“one-eth”), andnis the 2th<br>
(“two-eth”) letter.</p>
<p>You can use any expression, including variables and operators, as an index, but the value<br>
of the index has to be an integer. Otherwise you get:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>letter = fruit[1.5]<br>
TypeError: string indices must be integers, not float</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="len">8.2 len</h3>
<p>lenis a built-in function that returns the number of characters in a string:</p>
<p><strong>72 Chapter 8. Strings</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>fruit =‘banana’<br>
len(fruit)<br>
6</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>To get the last letter of a string, you might be tempted to try something like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>length = len(fruit)<br>
last = fruit[length]<br>
IndexError: string index out of range</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The reason for theIndexErroris that there is no letter in’banana’with the index 6. Since<br>
we started counting at zero, the six letters are numbered 0 to 5. To get the last character,<br>
you have to subtract 1 fromlength:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>last = fruit[length-1]<br>
print last<br>
a</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Alternatively, you can use negative indices, which count backward from the end of the<br>
string. The expressionfruit[-1]yields the last letter,fruit[-2]yields the second to last,<br>
and so on.</p>
<h3 id="traversal-with-aforloop">8.3 Traversal with aforloop</h3>
<p>A lot of computations involve processing a string one character at a time. Often they start<br>
at the beginning, select each character in turn, do something to it, and continue until the<br>
end. This pattern of processing is called a <strong>traversal</strong>. One way to write a traversal is with a<br>
whileloop:</p>
<p>index = 0<br>
while index &lt; len(fruit):<br>
letter = fruit[index]<br>
print letter<br>
index = index + 1</p>
<p>This loop traverses the string and displays each letter on a line by itself. The loop condition<br>
isindex &lt; len(fruit), so whenindexis equal to the length of the string, the condition is<br>
false, and the body of the loop is not executed. The last character accessed is the one with<br>
the indexlen(fruit)-1, which is the last character in the string.<br>
<strong>Exercise 8.1.</strong> Write a function that takes a string as an argument and displays the letters backward,<br>
one per line.</p>
<p>Another way to write a traversal is with aforloop:</p>
<p>for char in fruit:<br>
print char</p>
<p>Each time through the loop, the next character in the string is assigned to the variablechar.<br>
The loop continues until no characters are left.</p>
<p>The following example shows how to use concatenation (string addition) and aforloop<br>
to generate an abecedarian series (that is, in alphabetical order). In Robert McCloskey’s<br>
bookMake Way for Ducklings, the names of the ducklings are Jack, Kack, Lack, Mack, Nack,<br>
Ouack, Pack, and Quack. This loop outputs these names in order:</p>
<p><strong>8.4. String slices 73</strong></p>

<p>Jack<br>
Kack<br>
Lack<br>

Nack<br>
Oack<br>
Pack<br>

<p>Of course, that’s not quite right because “Ouack” and “Quack” are misspelled.<br>
<strong>Exercise 8.2.</strong> Modify the program to fix this error.</p>
<h3 id="string-slices">8.4 String slices</h3>
<p>A segment of a string is called a <strong>slice</strong>. Selecting a slice is similar to selecting a character:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>s =‘Monty Python’<br>
print s[0:5]<br>
Monty</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>print s[6:12]<br>
Python</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The operator[n:m]returns the part of the string from the “n-eth” character to the “m-eth”<br>
character, including the first but excluding the last. This behavior is counterintuitive, but<br>
it might help to imagine the indices pointingbetweenthe characters, as in Figure 8.1.</p>
<p>If you omit the first index (before the colon), the slice starts at the beginning of the string.<br>
If you omit the second index, the slice goes to the end of the string:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>fruit =‘banana’<br>
fruit[:3]<br>
‘ban’</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>fruit[3:]<br>
‘ana’</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>If the first index is greater than or equal to the second the result is an <strong>empty string</strong> , repre-<br>
sented by two quotation marks:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>fruit =‘banana’<br>
fruit[3:3]<br>
‘’</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>74 Chapter 8. Strings</strong></p>
<p>An empty string contains no characters and has length 0, but other than that, it is the same<br>
as any other string.<br>
<strong>Exercise 8.3.</strong> Given thatfruitis a string, what doesfruit[:]mean?</p>
<h3 id="strings-are-immutable">8.5 Strings are immutable</h3>
<p>It is tempting to use the[]operator on the left side of an assignment, with the intention of<br>
changing a character in a string. For example:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>greeting = ‘Hello, world!’<br>
greeting[0] = ‘J’<br>
TypeError: 'str’object does not support item assignment</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The “object” in this case is the string and the “item” is the character you tried to assign. For<br>
now, an <strong>object</strong> is the same thing as a value, but we will refine that definition later. An <strong>item</strong><br>
is one of the values in a sequence.</p>
<p>The reason for the error is that strings are <strong>immutable</strong> , which means you can’t change an<br>
existing string. The best you can do is create a new string that is a variation on the original:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>greeting = ‘Hello, world!’<br>
new_greeting = ‘J’ + greeting[1:]<br>
print new_greeting<br>
Jello, world!</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>This example concatenates a new first letter onto a slice ofgreeting. It has no effect on the<br>
original string.</p>
<h3 id="searching">8.6 Searching</h3>
<p>What does the following function do?</p>
<p>def find(word, letter):<br>
index = 0<br>
while index &lt; len(word):<br>
if word[index] == letter:<br>
return index<br>
index = index + 1<br>
return -1</p>
<p>In a sense,findis the opposite of the[]operator. Instead of taking an index and extracting<br>
the corresponding character, it takes a character and finds the index where that character<br>
appears. If the character is not found, the function returns-1.</p>
<p>This is the first example we have seen of areturnstatement inside a loop. Ifword[index]<br>
== letter, the function breaks out of the loop and returns immediately.</p>
<p>If the character doesn’t appear in the string, the program exits the loop normally and re-<br>
turns-1.</p>
<p>This pattern of computation—traversing a sequence and returning when we find what we<br>
are looking for—is called a <strong>search</strong>.<br>
<strong>Exercise 8.4.</strong> Modifyfindso that it has a third parameter, the index inwordwhere it should start<br>

<p><strong>8.7. Looping and counting 75</strong></p>
<h3 id="looping-and-counting">8.7 Looping and counting</h3>
<p>The following program counts the number of times the letteraappears in a string:</p>
<p>word =‘banana’<br>
count = 0<br>
for letter in word:<br>
if letter ==‘a’:<br>
count = count + 1<br>
print count</p>
<p>This program demonstrates another pattern of computation called a <strong>counter</strong>. The variable<br>
countis initialized to 0 and then incremented each time anais found. When the loop exits,<br>
countcontains the result—the total number ofa’s.<br>
<strong>Exercise 8.5.</strong> Encapsulate this code in a function namedcount, and generalize it so that it accepts<br>
the string and the letter as arguments.<br>
<strong>Exercise 8.6.</strong> Rewrite this function so that instead of traversing the string, it uses the three-<br>
parameter version offindfrom the previous section.</p>
<h3 id="string-methods">8.8 String methods</h3>
<p>A <strong>method</strong> is similar to a function—it takes arguments and returns a value—but the syntax<br>
is different. For example, the methoduppertakes a string and returns a new string with all<br>
uppercase letters:</p>
<p>Instead of the function syntaxupper(word), it uses the method syntaxword.upper().</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>word =‘banana’<br>
new_word = word.upper()<br>
print new_word<br>
BANANA</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>This form of dot notation specifies the name of the method,upper, and the name of the<br>
string to apply the method to,word. The empty parentheses indicate that this method<br>
takes no argument.</p>
<p>A method call is called an <strong>invocation</strong> ; in this case, we would say that we are invoking<br>
upperon theword.</p>
<p>As it turns out, there is a string method namedfindthat is remarkably similar to the<br>
function we wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>word =‘banana’<br>
index = word.find(‘a’)<br>
print index<br>
1</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>In this example, we invokefindonwordand pass the letter we are looking for as a param-<br>
eter.</p>
<p>Actually, thefindmethod is more general than our function; it can find substrings, not just<br>
characters:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>word.find(‘na’)<br>
2</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>76 Chapter 8. Strings</strong></p>
<p>It can take as a second argument the index where it should start:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>word.find(‘na’, 3)<br>
4</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>And as a third argument the index where it should stop:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>name = ‘bob’<br>
name.find(‘b’, 1, 2)<br>
-1</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>This search fails becausebdoes not appear in the index range from 1 to 2 (not including 2 ).<br>
<strong>Exercise 8.7.</strong> There is a string method calledcountthat is similar to the function in the previous<br>
exercise. Read the documentation of this method and write an invocation that counts the number of<br>
as in’banana’.<br>
<strong>Exercise 8.8.</strong> Read the documentation of the string methods athttp: // docs. python. org/ 2/<br>

<p>The documentation uses a syntax that might be confusing. For example, in<br>

<p>Other relational operations are useful for putting words in alphabetical order:</p>

<p>Python does not handle uppercase and lowercase letters the same way that people do. All<br>
the uppercase letters come before all the lowercase letters, so:</p>
<p>Your word, Pineapple, comes before banana.</p>
<p>A common way to address this problem is to convert strings to a standard format, such as<br>
all lowercase, before performing the comparison. Keep that in mind in case you have to<br>
defend yourself against a man armed with a Pineapple.</p>
<h3 id="debugging-7">8.11 Debugging</h3>
<p>When you use indices to traverse the values in a sequence, it is tricky to get the beginning<br>

</code></pre>
<pre><code>return True

<p>The firstifstatement checks whether the words are the same length. If not, we can return<br>
Falseimmediately and then, for the rest of the function, we can assume that the words are<br>
the same length. This is an example of the guardian pattern in Section 6.8.</p>

IndexError: string index out of range</p>
<p>For debugging this kind of error, my first move is to print the values of the indices imme-<br>

<p>IndexError: string index out of range</p>
<p>The first time through the loop, the value of jis 4, which is out of range for the<br>
string’pots’. The index of the last character is 3, so the initial value forjshould be<br>
len(word2)-1.</p>
<p>If I fix that error and run the program again, I get:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>is_reverse(‘pots’, ‘stop’)<br>
0 3<br>
1 2<br>
2 1<br>

</blockquote>
<p>This time we get the right answer, but it looks like the loop only ran three times, which is<br>
suspicious. To get a better idea of what is happening, it is useful to draw a state diagram.<br>
During the first iteration, the frame foris_reverseis shows in Figure 8.2.</p>
<p>I took a little license by arranging the variables in the frame and adding dotted lines to<br>
show that the values ofiandjindicate characters inword1andword2.<br>

<h3 id="reading-word-lists">9.1 Reading word lists</h3>
<p>For the exercises in this chapter we need a list of English words. There are lots of word<br>
lists available on the Web, but the one most suitable for our purpose is one of the word lists<br>
collected and contributed to the public domain by Grady Ward as part of the Moby lexi-<br>
con project (seehttp://wikipedia.org/wiki/Moby_Project). It is a list of 113,809 official<br>
crosswords; that is, words that are considered valid in crossword puzzles and other word<br>
games. In the Moby collection, the filename is113809of.fic; you can download a copy,<br>
with the simpler namewords.txt, fromhttp://thinkpython.com/code/words.txt.</p>
<p>This file is in plain text, so you can open it with a text editor, but you can also read it from<br>
Python. The built-in functionopentakes the name of the file as a parameter and returns a<br>
<strong>file object</strong> you can use to read the file.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>fin = open(‘words.txt’)<br>
print fin<br>
&lt;open file’words.txt’, mode’r’at 0xb7f4b380&gt;</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>finis a common name for a file object used for input. Mode’r’indicates that this file is<br>
open for reading (as opposed to’w’for writing).</p>
<p>The file object provides several methods for reading, includingreadline, which reads<br>
characters from the file until it gets to a newline and returns the result as a string:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>fin.readline()<br>
‘aa\r\n’</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The first word in this particular list is “aa,” which is a kind of lava. The sequence\r\n<br>
represents two whitespace characters, a carriage return and a newline, that separate this<br>
word from the next.</p>
<p>The file object keeps track of where it is in the file, so if you callreadlineagain, you get<br>
the next word:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>fin.readline()<br>
‘aah\r\n’</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The next word is “aah,” which is a perfectly legitimate word, so stop looking at me like<br>
that. Or, if it’s the whitespace that’s bothering you, we can get rid of it with the string<br>
methodstrip:</p>
<p><strong>82 Chapter 9. Case study: word play</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>line = fin.readline()<br>
word = line.strip()<br>
print word<br>
aahed</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>You can also use a file object as part of aforloop. This program readswords.txtand<br>
prints each word, one per line:</p>
<p>fin = open(‘words.txt’)<br>
for line in fin:<br>
word = line.strip()<br>
print word<br>
<strong>Exercise 9.1.</strong> Write a program that readswords.txtand prints only the words with more than 20<br>
characters (not counting whitespace).</p>
<h3 id="exercises-9">9.2 Exercises</h3>
<p>There are solutions to these exercises in the next section. You should at least attempt each<br>
one before you read the solutions.<br>
<strong>Exercise 9.2.</strong> In 1939 Ernest Vincent Wright published a 50,000 word novel calledGadsbythat<br>
does not contain the letter “e.” Since “e” is the most common letter in English, that’s not easy to<br>
do.</p>
<p>In fact, it is difficult to construct a solitary thought without using that most common symbol. It is<br>
slow going at first, but with caution and hours of training you can gradually gain facility.</p>
<p>All right, I’ll stop now.</p>
<p>Write a function calledhas_no_ethat returnsTrueif the given word doesn’t have the letter “e” in<br>
it.</p>
<p>Modify your program from the previous section to print only the words that have no “e” and com-<br>
pute the percentage of the words in the list have no “e.”<br>
<strong>Exercise 9.3.</strong> Write a function namedavoidsthat takes a word and a string of forbidden letters,<br>
and that returnsTrueif the word doesn’t use any of the forbidden letters.</p>
<p>Modify your program to prompt the user to enter a string of forbidden letters and then print the<br>
number of words that don’t contain any of them. Can you find a combination of 5 forbidden letters<br>
that excludes the smallest number of words?<br>
<strong>Exercise 9.4.</strong> Write a function nameduses_onlythat takes a word and a string of letters, and<br>
that returnsTrueif the word contains only letters in the list. Can you make a sentence using only<br>
the lettersacefhlo? Other than “Hoe alfalfa?”<br>
<strong>Exercise 9.5.</strong> Write a function nameduses_allthat takes a word and a string of required letters,<br>
and that returnsTrueif the word uses all the required letters at least once. How many words are<br>
there that use all the vowelsaeiou? How aboutaeiouy?<br>
<strong>Exercise 9.6.</strong> Write a function calledis_abecedarianthat returnsTrueif the letters in a word<br>
appear in alphabetical order (double letters are ok). How many abecedarian words are there?</p>
<h3 id="search">9.3 Search</h3>
<p>All of the exercises in the previous section have something in common; they can be solved<br>
with the search pattern we saw in Section 8.6. The simplest example is:</p>
<p><strong>9.4. Looping with indices 83</strong></p>
<p>def has_no_e(word):<br>
for letter in word:<br>
if letter ==‘e’:<br>
return False<br>
return True</p>
<p>Theforloop traverses the characters inword. If we find the letter “e”, we can immediately<br>
returnFalse; otherwise we have to go to the next letter. If we exit the loop normally, that<br>
means we didn’t find an “e”, so we returnTrue.</p>
<p>avoidsis a more general version ofhas_no_ebut it has the same structure:</p>
<p>def avoids(word, forbidden):<br>
for letter in word:<br>
if letter in forbidden:<br>
return False<br>
return True</p>
<p>We can returnFalseas soon as we find a forbidden letter; if we get to the end of the loop,<br>
we returnTrue.</p>
<p>uses_onlyis similar except that the sense of the condition is reversed:</p>
<p>def uses_only(word, available):<br>
for letter in word:<br>
if letter not in available:<br>
return False<br>
return True</p>
<p>Instead of a list of forbidden letters, we have a list of available letters. If we find a letter in<br>
wordthat is not inavailable, we can returnFalse.</p>
<p>uses_allis similar except that we reverse the role of the word and the string of letters:</p>
<p>def uses_all(word, required):<br>
for letter in required:<br>
if letter not in word:<br>
return False<br>
return True</p>
<p>Instead of traversing the letters inword, the loop traverses the required letters. If any of the<br>
required letters do not appear in the word, we can returnFalse.</p>
<p>If you were really thinking like a computer scientist, you would have recognized that<br>
uses_allwas an instance of a previously-solved problem, and you would have written:</p>
<p>def uses_all(word, required):<br>
return uses_only(required, word)</p>
<p>This is an example of a program development method called <strong>problem recognition</strong> , which<br>
means that you recognize the problem you are working on as an instance of a previously-<br>
solved problem, and apply a previously-developed solution.</p>
<h3 id="looping-with-indices">9.4 Looping with indices</h3>
<p>I wrote the functions in the previous section withforloops because I only needed the<br>
characters in the strings; I didn’t have to do anything with the indices.</p>
<p><strong>84 Chapter 9. Case study: word play</strong></p>
<p>Foris_abecedarianwe have to compare adjacent letters, which is a little tricky with afor<br>
loop:</p>
<p>def is_abecedarian(word):<br>
previous = word[0]<br>
for c in word:<br>
if c &lt; previous:<br>
return False<br>
previous = c<br>
return True</p>
<p>An alternative is to use recursion:</p>
<p>def is_abecedarian(word):<br>
if len(word) &lt;= 1:<br>
return True<br>
if word[0] &gt; word[1]:<br>
return False<br>
return is_abecedarian(word[1:])</p>
<p>Another option is to use awhileloop:</p>
<p>def is_abecedarian(word):<br>
i = 0<br>
while i &lt; len(word)-1:<br>
if word[i+1] &lt; word[i]:<br>
return False<br>
i = i+1<br>
return True</p>
<p>The loop starts ati=0and ends wheni=len(word)-1. Each time through the loop, it com-<br>
pares theith character (which you can think of as the current character) to thei+1th<br>
character (which you can think of as the next).</p>
<p>If the next character is less than (alphabetically before) the current one, then we have dis-<br>
covered a break in the abecedarian trend, and we returnFalse.</p>
<p>If we get to the end of the loop without finding a fault, then the word passes the test. To<br>
convince yourself that the loop ends correctly, consider an example like’flossy’. The<br>
length of the word is 6, so the last time the loop runs is wheniis 4, which is the index of<br>
the second-to-last character. On the last iteration, it compares the second-to-last character<br>
to the last, which is what we want.</p>
<p>Here is a version ofis_palindrome(see Exercise 6.6) that uses two indices; one starts at<br>
the beginning and goes up; the other starts at the end and goes down.</p>
<p>def is_palindrome(word):<br>
i = 0<br>
j = len(word)-1</p>
<pre><code>while i&lt;j:
if word[i] != word[j]:
return False
i = i+1
j = j-1
</code></pre>
<pre><code>return True
</code></pre>
<p><strong>9.5. Debugging 85</strong></p>
<p>Or, if you noticed that this is an instance of a previously-solved problem, you might have<br>
written:</p>
<p>def is_palindrome(word):<br>
return is_reverse(word, word)</p>
<p>Assuming you did Exercise 8.9.</p>
<h3 id="debugging-8">9.5 Debugging</h3>
<p>Testing programs is hard. The functions in this chapter are relatively easy to test because<br>
you can check the results by hand. Even so, it is somewhere between difficult and impos-<br>
sible to choose a set of words that test for all possible errors.</p>
<p>Takinghas_no_eas an example, there are two obvious cases to check: words that have an<br>
’e’ should returnFalse; words that don’t should returnTrue. You should have no trouble<br>
coming up with one of each.</p>
<p>Within each case, there are some less obvious subcases. Among the words that have an<br>
“e,” you should test words with an “e” at the beginning, the end, and somewhere in the<br>
middle. You should test long words, short words, and very short words, like the empty<br>
string. The empty string is an example of a <strong>special case</strong> , which is one of the non-obvious<br>
cases where errors often lurk.</p>
<p>In addition to the test cases you generate, you can also test your program with a word list<br>
likewords.txt. By scanning the output, you might be able to catch errors, but be careful:<br>
you might catch one kind of error (words that should not be included, but are) and not<br>
another (words that should be included, but aren’t).</p>
<p>In general, testing can help you find bugs, but it is not easy to generate a good set of test<br>
cases, and even if you do, you can’t be sure your program is correct.</p>
<p>According to a legendary computer scientist:</p>
<pre><code>Program testing can be used to show the presence of bugs, but never to show
their absence!

<h1 id="lists">Lists</h1>
<h3 id="a-list-is-a-sequence">10.1 A list is a sequence</h3>
<p>Like a string, a <strong>list</strong> is a sequence of values. In a string, the values are characters; in a list,<br>
they can be any type. The values in a list are called <strong>elements</strong> or sometimes <strong>items</strong>.</p>
<p>There are several ways to create a new list; the simplest is to enclose the elements in square<br>
brackets ([and]):</p>
<p>[10, 20, 30, 40]<br>
[‘crunchy frog’,‘ram bladder’, ‘lark vomit’]</p>
<p>The first example is a list of four integers. The second is a list of three strings. The elements<br>
of a list don’t have to be the same type. The following list contains a string, a float, an<br>
integer, and (lo!) another list:</p>
<p>[‘spam’, 2.0, 5, [10, 20]]</p>
<p>A list within another list is <strong>nested</strong>.</p>
<p>A list that contains no elements is called an empty list; you can create one with empty<br>
brackets,[].</p>
<p>As you might expect, you can assign list values to variables:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>cheeses = [‘Cheddar’, ‘Edam’,‘Gouda’]<br>
numbers = [17, 123]<br>
empty = []<br>
print cheeses, numbers, empty<br>
[‘Cheddar’,‘Edam’,‘Gouda’] [17, 123] []</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="lists-are-mutable">10.2 Lists are mutable</h3>
<p>The syntax for accessing the elements of a list is the same as for accessing the characters<br>
of a string—the bracket operator. The expression inside the brackets specifies the index.<br>
Remember that the indices start at 0:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>print cheeses[0]<br>
Cheddar</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>88 Chapter 10. Lists</strong></p>
<pre><code>0
1
</code></pre>
<pre><code>list

<pre><code>list

<pre><code>0

</code></pre>
<pre><code>’Cheddar’
’Edam’
’Gouda’
</code></pre>
<pre><code>list
cheeses
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Figure 10.1: State diagram.
</code></pre>
<p>Unlike strings, lists are mutable. When the bracket operator appears on the left side of an<br>
assignment, it identifies the element of the list that will be assigned.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>numbers = [17, 123]<br>
numbers[1] = 5<br>
print numbers<br>
[17, 5]</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The one-eth element ofnumbers, which used to be 123, is now 5.</p>
<p>You can think of a list as a relationship between indices and elements. This relationship is<br>
called a <strong>mapping</strong> ; each index “maps to” one of the elements. Figure 10.1 shows the state<br>
diagram forcheeses,numbersandempty:</p>
<p>Lists are represented by boxes with the word “list” outside and the elements of the list<br>
inside. cheesesrefers to a list with three elements indexed 0, 1 and 2.numberscontains<br>
two elements; the diagram shows that the value of the second element has been reassigned<br>
from 123 to 5.emptyrefers to a list with no elements.</p>
<p>List indices work the same way as string indices:</p>
<ul>
<li>Any integer expression can be used as an index.</li>
<li>If you try to read or write an element that does not exist, you get anIndexError.</li>
<li>If an index has a negative value, it counts backward from the end of the list.</li>
</ul>
<p>Theinoperator also works on lists.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>cheeses = [‘Cheddar’,‘Edam’,‘Gouda’]<br>
‘Edam’ in cheeses<br>
True</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>‘Brie’ in cheeses<br>
False</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>10.3. Traversing a list 89</strong></p>
<h3 id="traversing-a-list">10.3 Traversing a list</h3>
<p>The most common way to traverse the elements of a list is with aforloop. The syntax is<br>
the same as for strings:</p>
<p>for cheese in cheeses:<br>
print cheese</p>
<p>This works well if you only need to read the elements of the list. But if you want to write<br>
or update the elements, you need the indices. A common way to do that is to combine the<br>
functionsrangeandlen:</p>
<p>for i in range(len(numbers)):<br>
numbers[i] = numbers[i] * 2</p>
<p>This loop traverses the list and updates each element.lenreturns the number of elements<br>
in the list.rangereturns a list of indices from 0 ton−1, wherenis the length of the list.<br>
Each time through the loopigets the index of the next element. The assignment statement<br>
in the body usesito read the old value of the element and to assign the new value.</p>
<p>Aforloop over an empty list never executes the body:</p>
<p>for x in []:<br>
print’This never happens.’</p>
<p>Although a list can contain another list, the nested list still counts as a single element. The<br>
length of this list is four:</p>
<p>[‘spam’, 1, [‘Brie’,‘Roquefort’,‘Pol le Veq’], [1, 2, 3]]</p>
<h3 id="list-operations">10.4 List operations</h3>
<p>The+operator concatenates lists:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>a = [1, 2, 3]<br>
b = [4, 5, 6]<br>
c = a + b<br>
print c<br>
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Similarly, the*operator repeats a list a given number of times:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>[0] * 4<br>
[0, 0, 0, 0]</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>[1, 2, 3] * 3<br>
[1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The first example repeats[0]four times. The second example repeats the list[1, 2, 3]<br>
three times.</p>
<h3 id="list-slices">10.5 List slices</h3>
<p>The slice operator also works on lists:</p>
<p><strong>90 Chapter 10. Lists</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>t = [‘a’, ‘b’, ‘c’, ‘d’,‘e’,‘f’]<br>
t[1:3]<br>
[‘b’, ‘c’]</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>t[:4]<br>
[‘a’, ‘b’, ‘c’,‘d’]</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>t[3:]<br>
[‘d’, ‘e’, ‘f’]</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>If you omit the first index, the slice starts at the beginning. If you omit the second, the slice<br>
goes to the end. So if you omit both, the slice is a copy of the whole list.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>t[:]<br>
[‘a’, ‘b’, ‘c’,‘d’,‘e’,‘f’]</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Since lists are mutable, it is often useful to make a copy before performing operations that<br>
fold, spindle or mutilate lists.</p>
<p>A slice operator on the left side of an assignment can update multiple elements:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>t = [‘a’, ‘b’, ‘c’, ‘d’,‘e’,‘f’]<br>
t[1:3] = [‘x’, ‘y’]<br>
print t<br>
[‘a’, ‘x’, ‘y’,‘d’,‘e’,‘f’]</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="list-methods">10.6 List methods</h3>
<p>Python provides methods that operate on lists. For example,appendadds a new element<br>
to the end of a list:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>t = [‘a’, ‘b’, ‘c’]<br>
t.append(‘d’)<br>
print t<br>
[‘a’, ‘b’, ‘c’,‘d’]</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>extendtakes a list as an argument and appends all of the elements:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>t1 = [‘a’, ‘b’,‘c’]<br>
t2 = [‘d’, ‘e’]<br>
t1.extend(t2)<br>
print t1<br>
[‘a’, ‘b’, ‘c’,‘d’,‘e’]</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>This example leavest2unmodified.</p>
<p>sortarranges the elements of the list from low to high:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>t = [‘d’, ‘c’, ‘e’, ‘b’,‘a’]<br>
t.sort()<br>
print t<br>
[‘a’, ‘b’, ‘c’,‘d’,‘e’]</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>List methods are all void; they modify the list and returnNone. If you accidentally writet<br>
= t.sort(), you will be disappointed with the result.</p>
<p><strong>10.7. Map, filter and reduce 91</strong></p>
<h3 id="map-filter-and-reduce">10.7 Map, filter and reduce</h3>
<p>To add up all the numbers in a list, you can use a loop like this:</p>
<p>def add_all(t):<br>
total = 0<br>
for x in t:<br>
total += x<br>
return total</p>
<p>totalis initialized to 0. Each time through the loop,xgets one element from the list.<br>
The+=operator provides a short way to update a variable. This <strong>augmented assignment<br>
statement</strong> :</p>
<pre><code>total += x
</code></pre>
<p>is equivalent to:</p>
<pre><code>total = total + x
</code></pre>
<p>As the loop executes,totalaccumulates the sum of the elements; a variable used this way<br>
is sometimes called an <strong>accumulator</strong>.</p>
<p>Adding up the elements of a list is such a common operation that Python provides it as a<br>
built-in function,sum:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>t = [1, 2, 3]<br>
sum(t)<br>
6</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>An operation like this that combines a sequence of elements into a single value is some-<br>
times called <strong>reduce</strong>.<br>
<strong>Exercise 10.1.</strong> Write a function callednested_sumthat takes a nested list of integers and add up<br>
the elements from all of the nested lists.</p>
<p>Sometimes you want to traverse one list while building another. For example, the following<br>
function takes a list of strings and returns a new list that contains capitalized strings:</p>
<p>def capitalize_all(t):<br>
res = []<br>
for s in t:<br>
res.append(s.capitalize())<br>
return res</p>
<p>resis initialized with an empty list; each time through the loop, we append the next ele-<br>
ment. Soresis another kind of accumulator.</p>
<p>An operation likecapitalize_allis sometimes called a <strong>map</strong> because it “maps” a function<br>
(in this case the methodcapitalize) onto each of the elements in a sequence.<br>
<strong>Exercise 10.2.</strong> Usecapitalize_allto write a function namedcapitalize_nestedthat takes<br>
a nested list of strings and returns a new nested list with all strings capitalized.</p>
<p>Another common operation is to select some of the elements from a list and return a sublist.<br>
For example, the following function takes a list of strings and returns a list that contains<br>
only the uppercase strings:</p>
<p>def only_upper(t):<br>
res = []<br>
for s in t:</p>
<p><strong>92 Chapter 10. Lists</strong></p>
<pre><code>if s.isupper():
res.append(s)
return res
</code></pre>
<p>isupperis a string method that returnsTrueif the string contains only upper case letters.</p>
<p>An operation likeonly_upperis called a <strong>filter</strong> because it selects some of the elements and<br>
filters out the others.</p>
<p>Most common list operations can be expressed as a combination of map, filter and reduce.<br>
Because these operations are so common, Python provides language features to support<br>
them, including the built-in functionmapand an operator called a “list comprehension.”<br>
<strong>Exercise 10.3.</strong> Write a function that takes a list of numbers and returns the cumulative sum; that<br>
is, a new list where the ith element is the sum of the first i+ 1 elements from the original list. For<br>
example, the cumulative sum of[1, 2, 3]is[1, 3, 6].</p>
<h3 id="deleting-elements">10.8 Deleting elements</h3>
<p>There are several ways to delete elements from a list. If you know the index of the element<br>
you want, you can usepop:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>t = [‘a’, ‘b’, ‘c’]<br>
x = t.pop(1)<br>
print t<br>
[‘a’, ‘c’]</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>print x<br>
b</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>popmodifies the list and returns the element that was removed. If you don’t provide an<br>
index, it deletes and returns the last element.</p>
<p>If you don’t need the removed value, you can use thedeloperator:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>t = [‘a’, ‘b’, ‘c’]<br>
del t[1]<br>
print t<br>
[‘a’, ‘c’]</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>If you know the element you want to remove (but not the index), you can useremove:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>t = [‘a’, ‘b’, ‘c’]<br>
t.remove(‘b’)<br>
print t<br>
[‘a’, ‘c’]</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The return value fromremoveisNone.</p>
<p>To remove more than one element, you can usedelwith a slice index:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>t = [‘a’, ‘b’, ‘c’, ‘d’,‘e’,‘f’]<br>
del t[1:5]<br>
print t<br>
[‘a’, ‘f’]</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>As usual, the slice selects all the elements up to, but not including, the second index.<br>
<strong>Exercise 10.4.</strong> Write a function calledmiddlethat takes a list and returns a new list that contains<br>
all but the first and last elements. Somiddle([1,2,3,4])should return[2,3].<br>
<strong>Exercise 10.5.</strong> Write a function calledchopthat takes a list, modifies it by removing the first and<br>
last elements, and returnsNone.</p>
<p><strong>10.9. Lists and strings 93</strong></p>
<h3 id="lists-and-strings">10.9 Lists and strings</h3>
<p>A string is a sequence of characters and a list is a sequence of values, but a list of characters<br>
is not the same as a string. To convert from a string to a list of characters, you can uselist:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>s =‘spam’<br>
t = list(s)<br>
print t<br>
[‘s’,‘p’,‘a’,‘m’]</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Becauselistis the name of a built-in function, you should avoid using it as a variable<br>
name. I also avoidlbecause it looks too much like 1. So that’s why I uset.</p>
<p>Thelistfunction breaks a string into individual letters. If you want to break a string into<br>
words, you can use thesplitmethod:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>s =‘pining for the fjords’<br>
t = s.split()<br>
print t<br>
[‘pining’,‘for’, ‘the’,‘fjords’]</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>An optional argument called a <strong>delimiter</strong> specifies which characters to use as word bound-<br>
aries. The following example uses a hyphen as a delimiter:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>s =‘spam-spam-spam’<br>
delimiter =’-’<br>
s.split(delimiter)<br>
[‘spam’, ‘spam’,‘spam’]</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>joinis the inverse ofsplit. It takes a list of strings and concatenates the elements.joinis<br>
a string method, so you have to invoke it on the delimiter and pass the list as a parameter:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>t = [‘pining’, ‘for’, ‘the’,‘fjords’]<br>
delimiter =’’<br>
delimiter.join(t)<br>
‘pining for the fjords’</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>In this case the delimiter is a space character, sojoinputs a space between words. To<br>
concatenate strings without spaces, you can use the empty string,’’, as a delimiter.</p>
<h3 id="objects-and-values">10.10 Objects and values</h3>
<p>If we execute these assignment statements:</p>
<p>a =‘banana’<br>
b =‘banana’</p>
<p>We know thataandbboth refer to a string, but we don’t know whether they refer to the<br>
samestring. There are two possible states, shown in Figure 10.2.</p>
<p>In one case,aandbrefer to two different objects that have the same value. In the second<br>
case, they refer to the same object.</p>
<p>To check whether two variables refer to the same object, you can use theisoperator.</p>
<p><strong>94 Chapter 10. Lists</strong></p>
<pre><code>a
b
</code></pre>
<pre><code>’banana’
</code></pre>
<pre><code>a
b
</code></pre>
<pre><code>’banana’
’banana’
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Figure 10.2: State diagram.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>a
b
</code></pre>
<pre><code>[ 1, 2, 3 ]
[ 1, 2, 3 ]
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Figure 10.3: State diagram.
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>a =‘banana’<br>
b =‘banana’<br>
a is b<br>
True</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>In this example, Python only created one string object, and bothaandbrefer to it.</p>
<p>But when you create two lists, you get two objects:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>a = [1, 2, 3]<br>
b = [1, 2, 3]<br>
a is b<br>
False</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>So the state diagram looks like Figure 10.3.</p>
<p>In this case we would say that the two lists are <strong>equivalent</strong> , because they have the same el-<br>
ements, but not <strong>identical</strong> , because they are not the same object. If two objects are identical,<br>
they are also equivalent, but if they are equivalent, they are not necessarily identical.</p>
<p>Until now, we have been using “object” and “value” interchangeably, but it is more precise<br>
to say that an object has a value. If you execute[1,2,3], you get a list object whose value is<br>
a sequence of integers. If another list has the same elements, we say it has the same value,<br>
but it is not the same object.</p>
<h3 id="aliasing">10.11 Aliasing</h3>
<p>Ifarefers to an object and you assignb = a, then both variables refer to the same object:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>a = [1, 2, 3]<br>
b = a<br>
b is a<br>
True</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The state diagram looks like Figure 10.4.</p>
<p>The association of a variable with an object is called a <strong>reference</strong>. In this example, there are<br>
two references to the same object.</p>
<p>An object with more than one reference has more than one name, so we say that the object<br>
is <strong>aliased</strong>.</p>
<p>If the aliased object is mutable, changes made with one alias affect the other:</p>
<p><strong>10.12. List arguments 95</strong></p>
<pre><code>a

<pre><code>[ 1, 2, 3 ]

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>b[0] = 17<br>
print a<br>
[17, 2, 3]</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Although this behavior can be useful, it is error-prone. In general, it is safer to avoid<br>
aliasing when you are working with mutable objects.</p>
<p>For immutable objects like strings, aliasing is not as much of a problem. In this example:</p>
<p>a =‘banana’<br>
b =‘banana’</p>
<p>It almost never makes a difference whetheraandbrefer to the same string or not.</p>
<h3 id="list-arguments">10.12 List arguments</h3>
<p>When you pass a list to a function, the function gets a reference to the list. If the function<br>
modifies a list parameter, the caller sees the change. For example,delete_headremoves<br>
the first element from a list:</p>
<p>def delete_head(t):<br>
del t[0]</p>
<p>Here’s how it is used:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>letters = [‘a’,‘b’,‘c’]<br>
delete_head(letters)<br>
print letters<br>
[‘b’,‘c’]</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The parametertand the variablelettersare aliases for the same object. The stack diagram<br>
looks like Figure 10.5.</p>
<p>Since the list is shared by two frames, I drew it between them.</p>
<p>It is important to distinguish between operations that modify lists and operations that cre-<br>
ate new lists. For example, theappendmethod modifies a list, but the+operator creates a<br>
new list:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>t1 = [1, 2]<br>
t2 = t1.append(3)</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>96 Chapter 10. Lists</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>print t1<br>
[1, 2, 3]</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>print t2<br>
None</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>t3 = t1 + [4]<br>
print t3<br>
[1, 2, 3, 4]</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>This difference is important when you write functions that are supposed to modify lists.<br>
For example, this functiondoes notdelete the head of a list:</p>
<p>def bad_delete_head(t):<br>
t = t[1:] # WRONG!</p>
<p>The slice operator creates a new list and the assignment makestrefer to it, but none of that<br>
has any effect on the list that was passed as an argument.</p>
<p>An alternative is to write a function that creates and returns a new list. For example,tail<br>
returns all but the first element of a list:</p>
<p>def tail(t):<br>
return t[1:]</p>
<p>This function leaves the original list unmodified. Here’s how it is used:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>letters = [‘a’,‘b’,‘c’]<br>
rest = tail(letters)<br>
print rest<br>
[‘b’, ‘c’]</p>

<h3 id="debugging-9">10.13 Debugging</h3>
<p>Careless use of lists (and other mutable objects) can lead to long hours of debugging. Here<br>
are some common pitfalls and ways to avoid them:</p>
<ol>
<li>Don’t forget that most list methods modify the argument and returnNone. This is<br>
the opposite of the string methods, which return a new string and leave the original<br>
alone.<br>
If you are used to writing string code like this:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>word = word.strip()
</code></pre>
<pre><code>It is tempting to write list code like this:
</code></pre>
<pre><code>t = t.sort() # WRONG!
</code></pre>
<pre><code>BecausesortreturnsNone, the next operation you perform withtis likely to fail.
Before using list methods and operators, you should read the documentation care-
fully and then test them in interactive mode. The methods and operators that lists
share with other sequences (like strings) are documented athttp://docs.python.
org/2/library/stdtypes.html#typesseq. The methods and operators that only ap-
ply to mutable sequences are documented athttp://docs.python.org/2/library/
stdtypes.html#typesseq- mutable.
</code></pre>
<p><strong>10.14. Glossary 97</strong></p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Pick an idiom and stick with it.<br>
Part of the problem with lists is that there are too many ways to do things. For exam-<br>
ple, to remove an element from a list, you can usepop,remove,del, or even a slice<br>
assignment.<br>
To add an element, you can use theappendmethod or the+operator. Assuming that<br>
tis a list andxis a list element, these are right:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>t.append(x)
t = t + [x]
</code></pre>
<pre><code>And these are wrong:
</code></pre>
<pre><code>t.append([x]) # WRONG!
t = t.append(x) # WRONG!
t + [x] # WRONG!
t = t + x # WRONG!
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Try out each of these examples in interactive mode to make sure you understand
what they do. Notice that only the last one causes a runtime error; the other three are
legal, but they do the wrong thing.
</code></pre>
<ol start="3">
<li>Make copies to avoid aliasing.<br>
If you want to use a method likesortthat modifies the argument, but you need to<br>
keep the original list as well, you can make a copy.</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>orig = t[:]
t.sort()

<pre><code>In this example you could also use the built-in functionsorted, which returns a new,
sorted list and leaves the original alone. But in that case you should avoid using

dictionary they can be (almost) any type.</p>
<p>You can think of a dictionary as a mapping between a set of indices (which are called <strong>keys</strong> )<br>
and a set of values. Each key maps to a value. The association of a key and a value is called<br>
a <strong>key-value pair</strong> or sometimes an <strong>item</strong>.</p>
<p>As an example, we’ll build a dictionary that maps from English to Spanish words, so the<br>
keys and the values are all strings.</p>
<p>The functiondictcreates a new dictionary with no items. Becausedictis the name of a<br>
built-in function, you should avoid using it as a variable name.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>eng2sp = dict()<br>
print eng2sp<br>
{}</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The squiggly-brackets,{}, represent an empty dictionary. To add items to the dictionary,<br>
you can use square brackets:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>eng2sp[‘one’] =‘uno’</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>This line creates an item that maps from the key’one’to the value’uno’. If we print the<br>
dictionary again, we see a key-value pair with a colon between the key and value:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>print eng2sp<br>
{‘one’:‘uno’}</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>This output format is also an input format. For example, you can create a new dictionary<br>
with three items:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>eng2sp = {‘one’:‘uno’,‘two’: ‘dos’,‘three’:‘tres’}</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>But if you printeng2sp, you might be surprised:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>print eng2sp<br>
{‘one’:‘uno’,‘three’:‘tres’, ‘two’: ‘dos’}</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The order of the key-value pairs is not the same. In fact, if you type the same example<br>
on your computer, you might get a different result. In general, the order of items in a<br>
dictionary is unpredictable.</p>
<p>But that’s not a problem because the elements of a dictionary are never indexed with inte-<br>
ger indices. Instead, you use the keys to look up the corresponding values:</p>
<p><strong>102 Chapter 11. Dictionaries</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>print eng2sp[‘two’]<br>
‘dos’</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The key’two’always maps to the value’dos’so the order of the items doesn’t matter.</p>
<p>If the key isn’t in the dictionary, you get an exception:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>print eng2sp[‘four’]<br>
KeyError: ‘four’</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Thelenfunction works on dictionaries; it returns the number of key-value pairs:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>len(eng2sp)<br>
3</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Theinoperator works on dictionaries; it tells you whether something appears as akeyin<br>
the dictionary (appearing as a value is not good enough).</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>‘one’ in eng2sp<br>
True</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>‘uno’ in eng2sp<br>
False</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>To see whether something appears as a value in a dictionary, you can use the method<br>
values, which returns the values as a list, and then use theinoperator:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>vals = eng2sp.values()<br>
‘uno’ in vals<br>
True</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Theinoperator uses different algorithms for lists and dictionaries. For lists, it uses a search<br>
algorithm, as in Section 8.6. As the list gets longer, the search time gets longer in direct<br>
proportion. For dictionaries, Python uses an algorithm called a <strong>hashtable</strong> that has a re-<br>
markable property: theinoperator takes about the same amount of time no matter how<br>
many items there are in a dictionary. I won’t explain how that’s possible, but you can read<br>
more about it athttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table.<br>
<strong>Exercise 11.1.</strong> Write a function that reads the words inwords.txtand stores them as keys in a<br>
dictionary. It doesn’t matter what the values are. Then you can use theinoperator as a fast way to<br>
check whether a string is in the dictionary.</p>
<p>If you did Exercise 10.11, you can compare the speed of this implementation with the listinoperator<br>
and the bisection search.</p>
<h3 id="dictionary-as-a-set-of-counters">11.1 Dictionary as a set of counters</h3>
<p>Suppose you are given a string and you want to count how many times each letter appears.<br>
There are several ways you could do it:</p>
<ol>
<li>You could create 26 variables, one for each letter of the alphabet. Then you could tra-<br>
verse the string and, for each character, increment the corresponding counter, proba-<br>
bly using a chained conditional.</li>
<li>You could create a list with 26 elements. Then you could convert each character to<br>
a number (using the built-in functionord), use the number as an index into the list,<br>
and increment the appropriate counter.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>11.2. Looping and dictionaries 103</strong></p>
<ol start="3">
<li>You could create a dictionary with characters as keys and counters as the correspond-<br>
ing values. The first time you see a character, you would add an item to the dictionary.<br>
After that you would increment the value of an existing item.</li>
</ol>
<p>Each of these options performs the same computation, but each of them implements that<br>
computation in a different way.</p>
<p>An <strong>implementation</strong> is a way of performing a computation; some implementations are<br>
better than others. For example, an advantage of the dictionary implementation is that we<br>
don’t have to know ahead of time which letters appear in the string and we only have to<br>
make room for the letters that do appear.</p>
<p>Here is what the code might look like:</p>
<p>def histogram(s):<br>
d = dict()<br>
for c in s:<br>
if c not in d:<br>
d[c] = 1<br>
else:<br>
d[c] += 1<br>
return d</p>
<p>The name of the function is <strong>histogram</strong> , which is a statistical term for a set of counters (or<br>
frequencies).</p>
<p>The first line of the function creates an empty dictionary. Theforloop traverses the string.<br>
Each time through the loop, if the charactercis not in the dictionary, we create a new item<br>
with keycand the initial value 1 (since we have seen this letter once). Ifcis already in the<br>
dictionary we incrementd[c].</p>
<p>Here’s how it works:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>h = histogram(‘brontosaurus’)<br>
print h<br>
{‘a’: 1,‘b’: 1,‘o’: 2,‘n’: 1,‘s’: 2,‘r’: 2,‘u’: 2,‘t’: 1}</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The histogram indicates that the letters’a’and’b’appear once;'o’appears twice, and<br>
so on.<br>
<strong>Exercise 11.2.</strong> Dictionaries have a method calledgetthat takes a key and a default value. If the<br>
key appears in the dictionary,getreturns the corresponding value; otherwise it returns the default<br>
value. For example:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>h = histogram(‘a’)<br>
print h<br>
{‘a’: 1}</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>h.get(‘a’, 0)<br>
1</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>h.get(‘b’, 0)<br>
0</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Usegetto writehistogrammore concisely. You should be able to eliminate theifstatement.</p>
<h3 id="looping-and-dictionaries">11.2 Looping and dictionaries</h3>
<p>If you use a dictionary in aforstatement, it traverses the keys of the dictionary. For exam-<br>
ple,print_histprints each key and the corresponding value:</p>
<p><strong>104 Chapter 11. Dictionaries</strong></p>
<p>def print_hist(h):<br>
for c in h:<br>
print c, h[c]</p>
<p>Here’s what the output looks like:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>h = histogram(‘parrot’)<br>
print_hist(h)<br>
a 1<br>
p 1<br>
r 2<br>
t 1<br>
o 1</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, the keys are in no particular order.<br>
<strong>Exercise 11.3.</strong> Dictionaries have a method calledkeysthat returns the keys of the dictionary, in<br>
no particular order, as a list.</p>
<p>Modifyprint_histto print the keys and their values in alphabetical order.</p>
<h3 id="reverse-lookup">11.3 Reverse lookup</h3>
<p>Given a dictionarydand a keyk, it is easy to find the corresponding valuev = d[k]. This<br>
operation is called a <strong>lookup</strong>.</p>
<p>But what if you havevand you want to findk? You have two problems: first, there might<br>
be more than one key that maps to the valuev. Depending on the application, you might<br>
be able to pick one, or you might have to make a list that contains all of them. Second,<br>
there is no simple syntax to do a <strong>reverse lookup</strong> ; you have to search.</p>
<p>Here is a function that takes a value and returns the first key that maps to that value:</p>
<p>def reverse_lookup(d, v):<br>
for k in d:<br>
if d[k] == v:<br>
return k<br>
raise ValueError</p>
<p>This function is yet another example of the search pattern, but it uses a feature we haven’t<br>
seen before,raise. Theraisestatement causes an exception; in this case it causes a<br>
ValueError, which generally indicates that there is something wrong with the value of<br>
a parameter.</p>
<p>If we get to the end of the loop, that meansvdoesn’t appear in the dictionary as a value, so<br>
we raise an exception.</p>
<p>Here is an example of a successful reverse lookup:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>h = histogram(‘parrot’)<br>
k = reverse_lookup(h, 2)<br>
print k<br>
r</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>And an unsuccessful one:</p>
<p><strong>11.4. Dictionaries and lists 105</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>k = reverse_lookup(h, 3)<br>
Traceback (most recent call last):<br>
File “”, line 1, in?<br>
File “”, line 5, in reverse_lookup<br>
ValueError</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The result when you raise an exception is the same as when Python raises one: it prints a<br>
traceback and an error message.</p>
<p>Theraisestatement takes a detailed error message as an optional argument. For example:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>raise ValueError(‘value does not appear in the dictionary’)<br>
Traceback (most recent call last):<br>
File “”, line 1, in?<br>
ValueError: value does not appear in the dictionary</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>A reverse lookup is much slower than a forward lookup; if you have to do it often, or if the<br>
dictionary gets big, the performance of your program will suffer.<br>
<strong>Exercise 11.4.</strong> Modifyreverse_lookupso that it builds and returns a list ofallkeys that map to<br>
v, or an empty list if there are none.</p>
<h3 id="dictionaries-and-lists">11.4 Dictionaries and lists</h3>
<p>Lists can appear as values in a dictionary. For example, if you were given a dictionary that<br>
maps from letters to frequencies, you might want to invert it; that is, create a dictionary<br>
that maps from frequencies to letters. Since there might be several letters with the same<br>
frequency, each value in the inverted dictionary should be a list of letters.</p>
<p>Here is a function that inverts a dictionary:</p>
<p>def invert_dict(d):<br>
inverse = dict()<br>
for key in d:<br>
val = d[key]<br>
if val not in inverse:<br>
inverse[val] = [key]<br>
else:<br>
inverse[val].append(key)<br>
return inverse</p>
<p>Each time through the loop,keygets a key fromdandvalgets the corresponding value.<br>
Ifvalis not ininverse, that means we haven’t seen it before, so we create a new item and<br>
initialize it with a <strong>singleton</strong> (a list that contains a single element). Otherwise we have seen<br>
this value before, so we append the corresponding key to the list.</p>
<p>Here is an example:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>hist = histogram(‘parrot’)<br>
print hist<br>
{‘a’: 1,‘p’: 1,‘r’: 2,‘t’: 1,‘o’: 1}</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>inverse = invert_dict(hist)<br>
print inverse<br>

<p>Figure 11.1 is a state diagram showinghistandinverse. A dictionary is represented as a<br>
box with the typedictabove it and the key-value pairs inside. If the values are integers,<br>
floats or strings, I usually draw them inside the box, but I usually draw lists outside the<br>
box, just to keep the diagram simple.</p>
<p>Lists can be values in a dictionary, as this example shows, but they cannot be keys. Here’s<br>
what happens if you try:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>t = [1, 2, 3]<br>
d = dict()<br>
d[t] = ‘oops’<br>
Traceback (most recent call last):<br>
File “”, line 1, in?<br>
TypeError: list objects are unhashable</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>I mentioned earlier that a dictionary is implemented using a hashtable and that means that<br>
the keys have to be <strong>hashable</strong>.</p>
<p>A <strong>hash</strong> is a function that takes a value (of any kind) and returns an integer. Dictionaries<br>
use these integers, called hash values, to store and look up key-value pairs.</p>
<p>This system works fine if the keys are immutable. But if the keys are mutable, like lists,<br>
bad things happen. For example, when you create a key-value pair, Python hashes the key<br>
and stores it in the corresponding location. If you modify the key and then hash it again, it<br>
would go to a different location. In that case you might have two entries for the same key,<br>
or you might not be able to find a key. Either way, the dictionary wouldn’t work correctly.</p>
<p>That’s why the keys have to be hashable, and why mutable types like lists aren’t. The<br>
simplest way to get around this limitation is to use tuples, which we will see in the next<br>
chapter.</p>
<p>Since lists and dictionaries are mutable, they can’t be used as keys, but theycanbe used as<br>
values.<br>

<p>If you played with thefibonaccifunction from Section 6.7, you might have noticed that<br>

<p>the run time increases very quickly.</p>
<p>To understand why, consider Figure 11.2, which shows the <strong>call graph</strong> forfibonacciwith<br>
n=4:</p>
<p>A call graph shows a set of function frames, with lines connecting each frame to the frames<br>
of the functions it calls. At the top of the graph,fibonacciwithn=4callsfibonacciwith<br>
n=3andn=2. In turn,fibonacciwithn=3callsfibonacciwithn=2andn=1. And so on.</p>
<p>Count how many timesfibonacci(0)andfibonacci(1)are called. This is an inefficient<br>
solution to the problem, and it gets worse as the argument gets bigger.</p>
<p>One solution is to keep track of values that have already been computed by storing them<br>
in a dictionary. A previously computed value that is stored for later use is called a <strong>memo</strong>.<br>
Here is a “memoized” version offibonacci:</p>
<p>known = {0:0, 1:1}</p>
<p>def fibonacci(n):<br>
if n in known:<br>
return known[n]</p>
<pre><code>res = fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)

<p>knownis a dictionary that keeps track of the Fibonacci numbers we already know. It starts<br>
with two items: 0 maps to 0 and 1 maps to 1.</p>
<p>Wheneverfibonacciis called, it checksknown. If the result is already there, it can return<br>
immediately. Otherwise it has to compute the new value, add it to the dictionary, and<br>
return it.<br>

<h3 id="global-variables">11.6 Global variables</h3>
<p>In the previous example,knownis created outside the function, so it belongs to the special<br>
frame called__main__. Variables in__main__are sometimes called <strong>global</strong> because they<br>
can be accessed from any function. Unlike local variables, which disappear when their<br>
function ends, global variables persist from one function call to the next.</p>
<p>It is common to use global variables for <strong>flags</strong> ; that is, boolean variables that indicate (“flag”)<br>
whether a condition is true. For example, some programs use a flag namedverboseto<br>
control the level of detail in the output:</p>
<p>verbose = True</p>
<p>def example1():<br>
if verbose:<br>
print ‘Running example1’</p>
<p>If you try to reassign a global variable, you might be surprised. The following example is<br>
supposed to keep track of whether the function has been called:</p>
<p>been_called = False</p>
<p>def example2():<br>
been_called = True # WRONG</p>
<p>But if you run it you will see that the value ofbeen_calleddoesn’t change. The problem<br>
is thatexample2creates a new local variable namedbeen_called. The local variable goes<br>
away when the function ends, and has no effect on the global variable.</p>
<p>To reassign a global variable inside a function you have to <strong>declare</strong> the global variable before<br>
you use it:</p>
<p>been_called = False</p>
<p>def example2():<br>
global been_called<br>
been_called = True</p>
<p>Theglobalstatement tells the interpreter something like, “In this function, when I say<br>
been_called, I mean the global variable; don’t create a local one.”</p>
<p>Here’s an example that tries to update a global variable:</p>
<p>count = 0</p>
<p>def example3():<br>
count = count + 1 # WRONG</p>
<p>If you run it you get:</p>
<p>UnboundLocalError: local variable’count’referenced before assignment</p>
<p>Python assumes thatcountis local, which means that you are reading it before writing it.<br>
The solution, again, is to declarecountglobal.</p>
<p>def example3():<br>
global count<br>
count += 1</p>
<p>If the global value is mutable, you can modify it without declaring it:</p>
<p><strong>11.7. Long integers 109</strong></p>
<p>known = {0:0, 1:1}</p>
<p>def example4():<br>
known[2] = 1</p>
<p>So you can add, remove and replace elements of a global list or dictionary, but if you want<br>
to reassign the variable, you have to declare it:</p>
<p>def example5():<br>
global known<br>
known = dict()</p>
<h3 id="long-integers">11.7 Long integers</h3>
<p>If you computefibonacci(50), you get:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>fibonacci(50)<br>

</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>TheLat the end indicates that the result is a long integer, or typelong. In Python 3,long<br>
is gone; all integers, even really big ones, are typeint.</p>
<p>Values with typeinthave a limited range; long integers can be arbitrarily big, but as they<br>
get bigger they consume more space and time.</p>
<p>The mathematical operators work on long integers, and the functions in themathmodule,<br>
too, so in general any code that works withintwill also work withlong.</p>
<p>Any time the result of a computation is too big to be represented with an integer, Python<br>
converts the result as a long integer:</p>

<h3 id="debugging-10">11.8 Debugging</h3>
<p>As you work with bigger datasets it can become unwieldy to debug by printing and check-<br>
ing data by hand. Here are some suggestions for debugging large datasets:</p>
<p><strong>Scale down the input:</strong> If possible, reduce the size of the dataset. For example if the pro-<br>
gram reads a text file, start with just the first 10 lines, or with the smallest example<br>
you can find. You can either edit the files themselves, or (better) modify the program<br>
so it reads only the firstnlines.<br>
If there is an error, you can reducento the smallest value that manifests the error, and<br>
then increase it gradually as you find and correct errors.</p>
<p><strong>110 Chapter 11. Dictionaries</strong></p>
<p><strong>Check summaries and types:</strong> Instead of printing and checking the entire dataset, consider<br>
printing summaries of the data: for example, the number of items in a dictionary or<br>
the total of a list of numbers.<br>
A common cause of runtime errors is a value that is not the right type. For debugging<br>
this kind of error, it is often enough to print the type of a value.</p>
<p><strong>Write self-checks:</strong> Sometimes you can write code to check for errors automatically. For<br>
example, if you are computing the average of a list of numbers, you could check that<br>
the result is not greater than the largest element in the list or less than the smallest.<br>
This is called a “sanity check” because it detects results that are “insane.”<br>
Another kind of check compares the results of two different computations to see if<br>
they are consistent. This is called a “consistency check.”</p>
<p><strong>Pretty print the output:</strong> Formatting debugging output can make it easier to spot an error.<br>
We saw an example in Section 6.9. Thepprintmodule provides apprintfunction<br>
that displays built-in types in a more human-readable format.</p>
<p>Again, time you spend building scaffolding can reduce the time you spend debugging.</p>

<strong>Exercise 11.11.</strong> Here’s another Puzzler fromCar Talk ( <a href="http://www.cartalk.com/content/puzzlers:">http://www.cartalk.com/content/puzzlers:</a></p>
<pre><code>This was sent in by a fellow named Dan O’Leary. He came upon a common one-syllable,
five-letter word recently that has the following unique property. When you remove the
first letter, the remaining letters form a homophone of the original word, that is a word
that sounds exactly the same. Replace the first letter, that is, put it back and remove
the second letter and the result is yet another homophone of the original word. And the
question is, what’s the word?
Now I’m going to give you an example that doesn’t work. Let’s look at the five-letter
word, ‘wrack.’ W-R-A-C-K, you know like to ‘wrack with pain.’ If I remove the first
letter, I am left with a four-letter word, ’R-A-C-K.’ As in, ‘Holy cow, did you see the
rack on that buck! It must have been a nine-pointer!’ It’s a perfect homophone. If you
put the ‘w’ back, and remove the ‘r,’ instead, you’re left with the word, ‘wack,’ which is
a real word, it’s just not a homophone of the other two words.
But there is, however, at least one word that Dan and we know of, which will yield two
homophones if you remove either of the first two letters to make two, new four-letter
words. The question is, what’s the word?
</code></pre>
<p>You can use the dictionary from Exercise 11.1 to check whether a string is in the word list.</p>
<p>To check whether two words are homophones, you can use the CMU Pronouncing Dictionary.<br>

<h1 id="tuples">Tuples</h1>
<h3 id="tuples-are-immutable">12.1 Tuples are immutable</h3>
<p>A tuple is a sequence of values. The values can be any type, and they are indexed by<br>
integers, so in that respect tuples are a lot like lists. The important difference is that tuples<br>
are immutable.</p>
<p>Syntactically, a tuple is a comma-separated list of values:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>t =‘a’, ‘b’, ‘c’, ‘d’,‘e’</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Although it is not necessary, it is common to enclose tuples in parentheses:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>t = (‘a’, ‘b’, ‘c’,‘d’,‘e’)</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>To create a tuple with a single element, you have to include a final comma:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>t1 =‘a’,<br>
type(t1)<br>
&lt;type’tuple’&gt;</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>A value in parentheses is not a tuple:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>t2 = (‘a’)<br>
type(t2)<br>
&lt;type’str’&gt;</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Another way to create a tuple is the built-in functiontuple. With no argument, it creates<br>
an empty tuple:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>t = tuple()<br>
print t<br>
()</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>If the argument is a sequence (string, list or tuple), the result is a tuple with the elements of<br>
the sequence:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>t = tuple(‘lupins’)<br>
print t<br>
(‘l’,‘u’,‘p’,‘i’,‘n’, ‘s’)</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Becausetupleis the name of a built-in function, you should avoid using it as a variable<br>
name.</p>
<p>Most list operators also work on tuples. The bracket operator indexes an element:</p>
<p><strong>114 Chapter 12. Tuples</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>t = (‘a’, ‘b’, ‘c’, ‘d’,‘e’)<br>
print t[0]<br>
‘a’</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>And the slice operator selects a range of elements.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>print t[1:3]<br>
(‘b’, ‘c’)</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>But if you try to modify one of the elements of the tuple, you get an error:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>t[0] = ‘A’<br>
TypeError: object doesn’t support item assignment</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>You can’t modify the elements of a tuple, but you can replace one tuple with another:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>t = (‘A’,) + t[1:]<br>
print t<br>
(‘A’, ‘b’, ‘c’,‘d’,‘e’)</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="tuple-assignment">12.2 Tuple assignment</h3>
<p>It is often useful to swap the values of two variables. With conventional assignments, you<br>
have to use a temporary variable. For example, to swapaandb:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>temp = a<br>
a = b<br>
b = temp</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>This solution is cumbersome; <strong>tuple assignment</strong> is more elegant:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>a, b = b, a</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The left side is a tuple of variables; the right side is a tuple of expressions. Each value<br>
is assigned to its respective variable. All the expressions on the right side are evaluated<br>
before any of the assignments.</p>
<p>The number of variables on the left and the number of values on the right have to be the<br>
same:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>a, b = 1, 2, 3<br>
ValueError: too many values to unpack</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>More generally, the right side can be any kind of sequence (string, list or tuple). For exam-<br>
ple, to split an email address into a user name and a domain, you could write:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>addr = ‘monty@python.org’<br>
uname, domain = addr.split(’@’)</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The return value fromsplitis a list with two elements; the first element is assigned to<br>
uname, the second todomain.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>print uname<br>
monty</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>print domain<br>
<a href="http://python.org">python.org</a></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>12.3. Tuples as return values 115</strong></p>
<h3 id="tuples-as-return-values">12.3 Tuples as return values</h3>
<p>Strictly speaking, a function can only return one value, but if the value is a tuple, the effect<br>
is the same as returning multiple values. For example, if you want to divide two integers<br>
and compute the quotient and remainder, it is inefficient to computex/yand thenx%y. It<br>
is better to compute them both at the same time.</p>
<p>The built-in functiondivmodtakes two arguments and returns a tuple of two values, the<br>
quotient and remainder. You can store the result as a tuple:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>t = divmod(7, 3)<br>
print t<br>
(2, 1)</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Or use tuple assignment to store the elements separately:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>quot, rem = divmod(7, 3)<br>
print quot<br>
2</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>print rem<br>
1</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Here is an example of a function that returns a tuple:</p>
<p>def min_max(t):<br>
return min(t), max(t)</p>
<p>maxandminare built-in functions that find the largest and smallest elements of a sequence.<br>
min_maxcomputes both and returns a tuple of two values.</p>
<h3 id="variable-length-argument-tuples">12.4 Variable-length argument tuples</h3>
<p>Functions can take a variable number of arguments. A parameter name that begins with</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>gathers</strong> arguments into a tuple. For example,printalltakes any number of arguments<br>
and prints them:</li>
</ul>
<p>def printall(*args):<br>
print args</p>
<p>The gather parameter can have any name you like, butargsis conventional. Here’s how<br>
the function works:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>printall(1, 2.0,’ 3 ‘)<br>
(1, 2.0,’ 3 ')</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The complement of gather is <strong>scatter</strong>. If you have a sequence of values and you want to pass<br>
it to a function as multiple arguments, you can use the*operator. For example,divmod<br>
takes exactly two arguments; it doesn’t work with a tuple:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>t = (7, 3)<br>
divmod(t)<br>
TypeError: divmod expected 2 arguments, got 1</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>But if you scatter the tuple, it works:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>divmod(*t)<br>
(2, 1)<br>
<strong>Exercise 12.1.</strong> Many of the built-in functions use variable-length argument tuples. For example,<br>
maxandmincan take any number of arguments:</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>116 Chapter 12. Tuples</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>max(1,2,3)<br>
3</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Butsumdoes not.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>sum(1,2,3)<br>
TypeError: sum expected at most 2 arguments, got 3</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Write a function calledsumallthat takes any number of arguments and returns their sum.</p>
<h3 id="lists-and-tuples">12.5 Lists and tuples</h3>
<p>zipis a built-in function that takes two or more sequences and “zips” them into a list of<br>
tuples where each tuple contains one element from each sequence. In Python 3,zipreturns<br>
an iterator of tuples, but for most purposes, an iterator behaves like a list.</p>
<p>This example zips a string and a list:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>s =‘abc’<br>
t = [0, 1, 2]<br>
zip(s, t)<br>
[(‘a’, 0), (‘b’, 1), (‘c’, 2)]</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The result is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a character from the string and the<br>
corresponding element from the list.</p>
<p>If the sequences are not the same length, the result has the length of the shorter one.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>zip(‘Anne’,‘Elk’)<br>
[(‘A’,‘E’), (‘n’, ‘l’), (‘n’, ‘k’)]</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>You can use tuple assignment in aforloop to traverse a list of tuples:</p>
<p>t = [(‘a’, 0), (‘b’, 1), (‘c’, 2)]<br>
for letter, number in t:<br>
print number, letter</p>
<p>Each time through the loop, Python selects the next tuple in the list and assigns the ele-<br>
ments toletterandnumber. The output of this loop is:</p>
<p>0 a<br>
1 b<br>
2 c</p>
<p>If you combinezip,forand tuple assignment, you get a useful idiom for traversing two<br>
(or more) sequences at the same time. For example,has_matchtakes two sequences,t1<br>
andt2, and returnsTrueif there is an indexisuch thatt1[i] == t2[i]:</p>
<p>def has_match(t1, t2):<br>
for x, y in zip(t1, t2):<br>
if x == y:<br>
return True<br>
return False</p>
<p>If you need to traverse the elements of a sequence and their indices, you can use the built-in<br>
functionenumerate:</p>
<p>for index, element in enumerate(‘abc’):<br>
print index, element</p>
<p><strong>12.6. Dictionaries and tuples 117</strong></p>
<p>The output of this loop is:</p>
<p>0 a<br>
1 b<br>
2 c</p>
<p>Again.</p>
<h3 id="dictionaries-and-tuples">12.6 Dictionaries and tuples</h3>
<p>Dictionaries have a method calleditemsthat returns a list of tuples, where each tuple is a<br>
key-value pair.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>d = {‘a’:0,‘b’:1,‘c’:2}<br>
t = d.items()<br>
print t<br>
[(‘a’, 0), (‘c’, 2), (‘b’, 1)]</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>As you should expect from a dictionary, the items are in no particular order. In Python 3,<br>
itemsreturns an iterator, but for many purposes, iterators behave like lists.</p>
<p>Going in the other direction, you can use a list of tuples to initialize a new dictionary:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>t = [(‘a’, 0), (‘c’, 2), (‘b’, 1)]<br>
d = dict(t)<br>
print d<br>
{‘a’: 0,‘c’: 2,‘b’: 1}</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Combiningdictwithzipyields a concise way to create a dictionary:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>d = dict(zip(‘abc’, range(3)))<br>
print d<br>
{‘a’: 0,‘c’: 2,‘b’: 1}</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The dictionary methodupdatealso takes a list of tuples and adds them, as key-value pairs,<br>
to an existing dictionary.</p>
<p>Combiningitems, tuple assignment andfor, you get the idiom for traversing the keys and<br>
values of a dictionary:</p>
<p>for key, val in d.items():<br>
print val, key</p>
<p>The output of this loop is:</p>
<p>0 a<br>
2 c<br>
1 b</p>
<p>Again.</p>
<p>It is common to use tuples as keys in dictionaries (primarily because you can’t use lists). For<br>
example, a telephone directory might map from last-name, first-name pairs to telephone<br>
numbers. Assuming that we have definedlast,firstandnumber, we could write:</p>
<p>directory[last,first] = number</p>
<p>The expression in brackets is a tuple. We could use tuple assignment to traverse this dic-<br>
tionary.</p>

tuple tolastandfirst, then prints the name and corresponding telephone number.</p>
<p>There are two ways to represent tuples in a state diagram. The more detailed version<br>
shows the indices and elements just as they appear in a list. For example, the tuple<br>
(‘Cleese’, ‘John’)would appear as in Figure 12.1.</p>
<p>But in a larger diagram you might want to leave out the details. For example, a diagram of<br>
the telephone directory might appear as in Figure 12.2.</p>
<p>Here the tuples are shown using Python syntax as a graphical shorthand.</p>
<p>The telephone number in the diagram is the complaints line for the BBC, so please don’t<br>

<h3 id="comparing-tuples">12.7 Comparing tuples</h3>
<p>The relational operators work with tuples and other sequences; Python starts by comparing<br>
the first element from each sequence. If they are equal, it goes on to the next elements, and<br>
so on, until it finds elements that differ. Subsequent elements are not considered (even if<br>
they are really big).</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>(0, 1, 2) &lt; (0, 3, 4)<br>
True</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>(0, 1, 2000000) &lt; (0, 3, 4)<br>
True</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Thesortfunction works the same way. It sorts primarily by first element, but in the case<br>
of a tie, it sorts by second element, and so on.</p>
<p>This feature lends itself to a pattern called <strong>DSU</strong> for</p>
<p><strong>12.8. Sequences of sequences 119</strong></p>
<p><strong>Decorate</strong> a sequence by building a list of tuples with one or more sort keys preceding the<br>
elements from the sequence,</p>
<p><strong>Sort</strong> the list of tuples, and</p>
<p><strong>Undecorate</strong> by extracting the sorted elements of the sequence.</p>
<p>For example, suppose you have a list of words and you want to sort them from longest to<br>
shortest:</p>
<p>def sort_by_length(words):<br>
t = []<br>
for word in words:<br>
t.append((len(word), word))</p>
<pre><code>t.sort(reverse=True)
</code></pre>
<pre><code>res = []
for length, word in t:
res.append(word)
return res
</code></pre>
<p>The first loop builds a list of tuples, where each tuple is a word preceded by its length.</p>
<p>sortcompares the first element, length, first, and only considers the second element to<br>
break ties. The keyword argumentreverse=Truetellssortto go in decreasing order.</p>
<p>The second loop traverses the list of tuples and builds a list of words in descending order<br>
of length.<br>
<strong>Exercise 12.2.</strong> In this example, ties are broken by comparing words, so words with the same length<br>
appear in reverse alphabetical order. For other applications you might want to break ties at ran-<br>
dom. Modify this example so that words with the same length appear in random order. Hint:<br>

<h3 id="sequences-of-sequences">12.8 Sequences of sequences</h3>
<p>I have focused on lists of tuples, but almost all of the examples in this chapter also work<br>
with lists of lists, tuples of tuples, and tuples of lists. To avoid enumerating the possible<br>
combinations, it is sometimes easier to talk about sequences of sequences.</p>
<p>In many contexts, the different kinds of sequences (strings, lists and tuples) can be used<br>
interchangeably. So how and why do you choose one over the others?</p>
<p>To start with the obvious, strings are more limited than other sequences because the ele-<br>
ments have to be characters. They are also immutable. If you need the ability to change the<br>
characters in a string (as opposed to creating a new string), you might want to use a list of<br>
characters instead.</p>
<p>Lists are more common than tuples, mostly because they are mutable. But there are a few<br>
cases where you might prefer tuples:</p>
<ol>
<li>In some contexts, like areturnstatement, it is syntactically simpler to create a tuple<br>
than a list. In other contexts, you might prefer a list.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>120 Chapter 12. Tuples</strong></p>
<ol start="2">
<li>If you want to use a sequence as a dictionary key, you have to use an immutable type<br>
like a tuple or string.</li>
<li>If you are passing a sequence as an argument to a function, using tuples reduces the<br>
potential for unexpected behavior due to aliasing.</li>
</ol>
<p>Because tuples are immutable, they don’t provide methods likesortandreverse, which<br>
modify existing lists. But Python provides the built-in functionssortedandreversed,<br>
which take any sequence as a parameter and return a new list with the same elements in a<br>
different order.</p>
<h3 id="debugging-11">12.9 Debugging</h3>
<p>Lists, dictionaries and tuples are known generically as <strong>data structures</strong> ; in this chapter we<br>
are starting to see compound data structures, like lists of tuples, and dictionaries that con-<br>
tain tuples as keys and lists as values. Compound data structures are useful, but they are<br>
prone to what I call <strong>shape errors</strong> ; that is, errors caused when a data structure has the wrong<br>
type, size or composition. For example, if you are expecting a list with one integer and I<br>
give you a plain old integer (not in a list), it won’t work.</p>
<p>To help debug these kinds of errors, I have written a module calledstructshapethat<br>
provides a function, also calledstructshape, that takes any kind of data structure as<br>
an argument and returns a string that summarizes its shape. You can download it from<br>
<a href="http://thinkpython.com/code/structshape.py">http://thinkpython.com/code/structshape.py</a></p>

type:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
