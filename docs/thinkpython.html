<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span>*<span>The strange history of this book</span></p>
<p>In January 1999 I was preparing to teach an introductory programming class in Java. I had taught it three times and I was getting frustrated. The failure rate in the class was too high and, even for students who succeeded, the overall level of achievement was too low.</p>
<p>One of the problems I saw was the books. They were too big, with too much unnecessary detail about Java, and not enough high-level guidance about how to program. And they all suffered from the trap door effect: they would start out easy, proceed gradually, and then somewhere around Chapter 5 the bottom would fall out. The students would get too much new material, too fast, and I would spend the rest of the semester picking up the pieces.</p>
<p>Two weeks before the first day of classes, I decided to write my own book. My goals were:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Keep it short. It is better for students to read 10 pages than not read 50 pages.</p></li>
<li><p>Be careful with vocabulary. I tried to minimize jargon and define each term at first use.</p></li>
<li><p>Build gradually. To avoid trap doors, I took the most difficult topics and split them into a series of small steps.</p></li>
<li><p>Focus on programming, not the programming language. I included the minimum useful subset of Java and left out the rest.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>I needed a title, so on a whim I chose <span><em>How to Think Like a Computer Scientist</em></span>.</p>
<p>My first version was rough, but it worked. Students did the reading, and they understood enough that I could spend class time on the hard topics, the interesting topics and (most important) letting the students practice.</p>
<p>I released the book under the GNU Free Documentation License, which allows users to copy, modify, and distribute the book.</p>
<p>What happened next is the cool part. Jeff Elkner, a high school teacher in Virginia, adopted my book and translated it into Python. He sent me a copy of his translation, and I had the unusual experience of learning Python by reading my own book. As Green Tea Press, I published the first Python version in 2001.</p>
<p>In 2003 I started teaching at Olin College and I got to teach Python for the first time. The contrast with Java was striking. Students struggled less, learned more, worked on more interesting projects, and generally had a lot more fun.</p>
<p>Since then I’ve continued to develop the book, correcting errors, improving some of the examples and adding material, especially exercises.</p>
<p>The result is this book, now with the less grandiose title <span><em>Think Python</em></span>. Some of the changes are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I added a section about debugging at the end of each chapter. These sections present general techniques for finding and avoiding bugs, and warnings about Python pitfalls.</p></li>
<li><p>I added more exercises, ranging from short tests of understanding to a few substantial projects. Most exercises include a link to my solution.</p></li>
<li><p>I added a series of case studies—longer examples with exercises, solutions, and discussion.</p></li>
<li><p>I expanded the discussion of program development plans and basic design patterns.</p></li>
<li><p>I added appendices about debugging and analysis of algorithms.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The second edition of <span><em>Think Python</em></span> has these new features:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The book and all supporting code have been updated to Python 3.</p></li>
<li><p>I added a few sections, and more details on the web, to help beginners get started running Python in a browser, so you don’t have to deal with installing Python until you want to.</p></li>
<li><p>For Chapter <a href="#turtle" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="turtle">[turtle]</a> I switched from my own turtle graphics package, called Swampy, to a more standard Python module, <span><code> turtle</code></span>, which is easier to install and more powerful.</p></li>
<li><p>I added a new chapter called “The Goodies”, which introduces some additional Python features that are not strictly necessary, but sometimes handy.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>I hope you enjoy working with this book, and that it helps you learn to program and think like a computer scientist, at least a little bit.</p>

<h1 id="the-way-of-the-program">The way of the program</h1>
<p>The goal of this book is to teach you to think like a computer scientist. This way of thinking combines some of the best features of mathematics, engineering, and natural science. Like mathematicians, computer scientists use formal languages to denote ideas (specifically computations). Like engineers, they design things, assembling components into systems and evaluating tradeoffs among alternatives. Like scientists, they observe the behavior of complex systems, form hypotheses, and test predictions.</p>
<p>The single most important skill for a computer scientist is <span> <strong>problem solving</strong></span>. Problem solving means the ability to formulate problems, think creatively about solutions, and express a solution clearly and accurately. As it turns out, the process of learning to program is an excellent opportunity to practice problem-solving skills. That’s why this chapter is called, “The way of the program”.</p>
<p>On one level, you will be learning to program, a useful skill by itself. On another level, you will use programming as a means to an end. As we go along, that end will become clearer.</p>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>What is a program?</span></p>
<p>A <span><strong>program</strong></span> is a sequence of instructions that specifies how to perform a computation. The computation might be something mathematical, such as solving a system of equations or finding the roots of a polynomial, but it can also be a symbolic computation, such as searching and replacing text in a document or something graphical, like processing an image or playing a video.</p>
<p>The details look different in different languages, but a few basic instructions appear in just about every language:</p>
<dl>
<dt>input:</dt>
<dd><p>Get data from the keyboard, a file, the network, or some other device.</p>
</dd>
<dt>output:</dt>
<dd><p>Display data on the screen, save it in a file, send it over the network, etc.</p>
</dd>
<dt>math:</dt>
<dd><p>Perform basic mathematical operations like addition and multiplication.</p>
</dd>
<dt>conditional execution:</dt>
<dd><p>Check for certain conditions and run the appropriate code.</p>
</dd>
<dt>repetition:</dt>
<dd><p>Perform some action repeatedly, usually with some variation.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Believe it or not, that’s pretty much all there is to it. Every program you’ve ever used, no matter how complicated, is made up of instructions that look pretty much like these. So you can think of programming as the process of breaking a large, complex task into smaller and smaller subtasks until the subtasks are simple enough to be performed with one of these basic instructions.</p>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>Running Python</span></p>
<p>One of the challenges of getting started with Python is that you might have to install Python and related software on your computer. If you are familiar with your operating system, and especially if you are comfortable with the command-line interface, you will have no trouble installing Python. But for beginners, it can be painful to learn about system administration and programming at the same time.</p>
<p>To avoid that problem, I recommend that you start out running Python in a browser. Later, when you are comfortable with Python, I’ll make suggestions for installing Python on your computer.</p>
<p>There are a number of web pages you can use to run Python. If you already have a favorite, go ahead and use it. Otherwise I recommend PythonAnywhere. I provide detailed instructions for getting started at <a href="http://tinyurl.com/thinkpython2e">http://tinyurl.com/thinkpython2e</a>.</p>
<p>There are two versions of Python, called Python 2 and Python 3. They are very similar, so if you learn one, it is easy to switch to the other. In fact, there are only a few differences you will encounter as a beginner. This book is written for Python 3, but I include some notes about Python 2.</p>
<p>The Python <span><strong>interpreter</strong></span> is a program that reads and executes Python code. Depending on your environment, you might start the interpreter by clicking on an icon, or by typing <span><code>python</code></span> on a command line. When it starts, you should see output like this:</p>
<pre><code>Python 3.4.0 (default, Jun 19 2015, 14:20:21) 
[GCC 4.8.2] on linux
Type &quot;help&quot;, &quot;copyright&quot;, &quot;credits&quot; or &quot;license&quot; for more information.
&gt;&gt;&gt; </code></pre>
<p>The first three lines contain information about the interpreter and the operating system it’s running on, so it might be different for you. But you should check that the version number, which is <span><code>3.4.0</code></span> in this example, begins with 3, which indicates that you are running Python 3. If it begins with 2, you are running (you guessed it) Python 2.</p>
<p>The last line is a <span><strong>prompt</strong></span> that indicates that the interpreter is ready for you to enter code. If you type a line of code and hit Enter, the interpreter displays the result:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; 1 + 1
2</code></pre>
<p>Now you’re ready to get started. From here on, I assume that you know how to start the Python interpreter and run code.</p>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>The first program</span> <span id="hello" label="hello">[hello]</span></p>
<p>Traditionally, the first program you write in a new language is called “Hello, World!” because all it does is display the words “Hello, World!”. In Python, it looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; print(&#39;Hello, World!&#39;)</code></pre>
<p>This is an example of a <span><strong>print statement</strong></span>, although it doesn’t actually print anything on paper. It displays a result on the screen. In this case, the result is the words</p>
<pre><code>Hello, World!</code></pre>
<p>The quotation marks in the program mark the beginning and end of the text to be displayed; they don’t appear in the result.</p>
<p>The parentheses indicate that <span><code>print</code></span> is a function. We’ll get to functions in Chapter <a href="#funcchap" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="funcchap">4</a>.</p>
<p>In Python 2, the print statement is slightly different; it is not a function, so it doesn’t use parentheses.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; print &#39;Hello, World!&#39;</code></pre>
<p>This distinction will make more sense soon, but that’s enough to get started.</p>

<p>After “Hello, World”, the next step is arithmetic. Python provides <span><strong>operators</strong></span>, which are special symbols that represent computations like addition and multiplication.</p>
<p>The operators <span><code>+</code></span>, <span><code>-</code></span>, and <span><code></code></span> perform addition, subtraction, and multiplication, as in the following examples:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; 40 + 2
42
&gt;&gt;&gt; 43 - 1
42
&gt;&gt;&gt; 6 * 7
42</code></pre>
<p>The operator <span><code>/</code></span> performs division:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; 84 / 2
42.0</code></pre>
<p>You might wonder why the result is <span><code>42.0</code></span> instead of <span><code>42</code></span>. I’ll explain in the next section.</p>
<p>Finally, the operator <span><code>*</code></span> performs exponentiation; that is, it raises a number to a power:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; 6**2 + 6
42</code></pre>
<p>In some other languages, <code>^</code> is used for exponentiation, but in Python it is a bitwise operator called XOR. If you are not familiar with bitwise operators, the result will surprise you:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; 6 ^ 2
4</code></pre>
<p>I won’t cover bitwise operators in this book, but you can read about them at <a href="http://wiki.python.org/moin/BitwiseOperators">http://wiki.python.org/moin/BitwiseOperators</a>.</p>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>Values and types</span></p>
<p>A <span><strong>value</strong></span> is one of the basic things a program works with, like a letter or a number. Some values we have seen so far are <span><code>2</code></span>, <span><code>42.0</code></span>, and <code>'Hello, World!'</code>.</p>
<p>These values belong to different <span><strong>types</strong></span>: <span><code>2</code></span> is an <span><strong>integer</strong></span>, <span><code>42.0</code></span> is a <span><strong>floating-point number</strong></span>, and <code>'Hello, World!'</code> is a <span><strong>string</strong></span>, so-called because the letters it contains are strung together.</p>
<p>If you are not sure what type a value has, the interpreter can tell you:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; type(2)
&lt;class &#39;int&#39;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; type(42.0)
&lt;class &#39;float&#39;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; type(&#39;Hello, World!&#39;)
&lt;class &#39;str&#39;&gt;</code></pre>
<p>In these results, the word “class” is used in the sense of a category; a type is a category of values.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, integers belong to the type <span><code>int</code></span>, strings belong to <span><code>str</code></span> and floating-point numbers belong to <span><code>float</code></span>.</p>
<p>What about values like <code>'2'</code> and <code>'42.0'</code>? They look like numbers, but they are in quotation marks like strings.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; type(&#39;2&#39;)
&lt;class &#39;str&#39;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; type(&#39;42.0&#39;)
&lt;class &#39;str&#39;&gt;</code></pre>
<p>They’re strings.</p>
<p>When you type a large integer, you might be tempted to use commas between groups of digits, as in <span><code>1,000,000</code></span>. This is not a legal <span><em>integer</em></span> in Python, but it is legal:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; 1,000,000
(1, 0, 0)</code></pre>
<p>That’s not what we expected at all! Python interprets <span><code> 1,000,000</code></span> as a comma-separated sequence of integers. We’ll learn more about this kind of sequence later.</p>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>Formal and natural languages</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Natural languages</strong></span> are the languages people speak, such as English, Spanish, and French. They were not designed by people (although people try to impose some order on them); they evolved naturally.</p>
<p><span><strong>Formal languages</strong></span> are languages that are designed by people for specific applications. For example, the notation that mathematicians use is a formal language that is particularly good at denoting relationships among numbers and symbols. Chemists use a formal language to represent the chemical structure of molecules. And most importantly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span><strong>Programming languages are formal languages that have been designed to express computations.</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Formal languages tend to have strict <span><strong>syntax</strong></span> rules that govern the structure of statements. For example, in mathematics the statement <span class="math inline">3 + 3 = 6</span> has correct syntax, but <span class="math inline">3 +  = 3$6</span> does not. In chemistry <span class="math inline"><em>H</em><sub>2</sub><em>O</em></span> is a syntactically correct formula, but <span class="math inline"><em></em><sub>2</sub><em>Z</em><em>z</em></span> is not.</p>
<p>Syntax rules come in two flavors, pertaining to <span><strong>tokens</strong></span> and structure. Tokens are the basic elements of the language, such as words, numbers, and chemical elements. One of the problems with <span class="math inline">3 +  = 3$6</span> is that <span class="math inline">$</span> is not a legal token in mathematics (at least as far as I know). Similarly, <span class="math inline"><em></em><sub>2</sub><em>Z</em><em>z</em></span> is not legal because there is no element with the abbreviation <span class="math inline"><em>Z</em><em>z</em></span>.</p>
<p>The second type of syntax rule pertains to the way tokens are combined. The equation <span class="math inline">3 + /3</span> is illegal because even though <span class="math inline">+</span> and <span class="math inline">/</span> are legal tokens, you can’t have one right after the other. Similarly, in a chemical formula the subscript comes after the element name, not before.</p>
<p>This is @ well-structured Engli$h sentence with invalid t*kens in it. This sentence all valid tokens has, but invalid structure with.</p>
<p>When you read a sentence in English or a statement in a formal language, you have to figure out the structure (although in a natural language you do this subconsciously). This process is called <span><strong>parsing</strong></span>.</p>
<p>Although formal and natural languages have many features in common—tokens, structure, and syntax—there are some differences:</p>
<dl>
<dt>ambiguity:</dt>
<dd><p>Natural languages are full of ambiguity, which people deal with by using contextual clues and other information. Formal languages are designed to be nearly or completely unambiguous, which means that any statement has exactly one meaning, regardless of context.</p>
</dd>
<dt>redundancy:</dt>
<dd><p>In order to make up for ambiguity and reduce misunderstandings, natural languages employ lots of redundancy. As a result, they are often verbose. Formal languages are less redundant and more concise.</p>
</dd>
<dt>literalness:</dt>
<dd><p>Natural languages are full of idiom and metaphor. If I say, “The penny dropped”, there is probably no penny and nothing dropping (this idiom means that someone understood something after a period of confusion). Formal languages mean exactly what they say.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Because we all grow up speaking natural languages, it is sometimes hard to adjust to formal languages. The difference between formal and natural language is like the difference between poetry and prose, but more so:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Poetry:</dt>
<dd><p>Words are used for their sounds as well as for their meaning, and the whole poem together creates an effect or emotional response. Ambiguity is not only common but often deliberate.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Prose:</dt>
<dd><p>The literal meaning of words is more important, and the structure contributes more meaning. Prose is more amenable to analysis than poetry but still often ambiguous.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Programs:</dt>
<dd><p>The meaning of a computer program is unambiguous and literal, and can be understood entirely by analysis of the tokens and structure.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Formal languages are more dense than natural languages, so it takes longer to read them. Also, the structure is important, so it is not always best to read from top to bottom, left to right. Instead, learn to parse the program in your head, identifying the tokens and interpreting the structure. Finally, the details matter. Small errors in spelling and punctuation, which you can get away with in natural languages, can make a big difference in a formal language.</p>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>Debugging</span></p>
<p>Programmers make mistakes. For whimsical reasons, programming errors are called <span><strong>bugs</strong></span> and the process of tracking them down is called <span><strong>debugging</strong></span>.</p>
<p>Programming, and especially debugging, sometimes brings out strong emotions. If you are struggling with a difficult bug, you might feel angry, despondent, or embarrassed.</p>
<p>There is evidence that people naturally respond to computers as if they were people. When they work well, we think of them as teammates, and when they are obstinate or rude, we respond to them the same way we respond to rude, obstinate people (Reeves and Nass, <span><em>The Media Equation: How People Treat Computers, Television, and New Media Like Real People and Places</em></span>).</p>
<p>Preparing for these reactions might help you deal with them. One approach is to think of the computer as an employee with certain strengths, like speed and precision, and particular weaknesses, like lack of empathy and inability to grasp the big picture.</p>
<p>Your job is to be a good manager: find ways to take advantage of the strengths and mitigate the weaknesses. And find ways to use your emotions to engage with the problem, without letting your reactions interfere with your ability to work effectively.</p>
<p>Learning to debug can be frustrating, but it is a valuable skill that is useful for many activities beyond programming. At the end of each chapter there is a section, like this one, with my suggestions for debugging. I hope they help!</p>

<p>It is a good idea to read this book in front of a computer so you can try out the examples as you go.</p>
<p>Whenever you are experimenting with a new feature, you should try to make mistakes. For example, in the “Hello, world!” program, what happens if you leave out one of the quotation marks? What if you leave out both? What if you spell <span><code>print</code></span> wrong?</p>
<p>This kind of experiment helps you remember what you read; it also helps when you are programming, because you get to know what the error messages mean. It is better to make mistakes now and on purpose than later and accidentally.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>In a print statement, what happens if you leave out one of the parentheses, or both?</p></li>
<li><p>If you are trying to print a string, what happens if you leave out one of the quotation marks, or both?</p></li>
<li><p>You can use a minus sign to make a negative number like <span><code>-2</code></span>. What happens if you put a plus sign before a number? What about <span><code>2++2</code></span>?</p></li>
<li><p>In math notation, leading zeros are ok, as in <span><code>09</code></span>. What happens if you try this in Python? What about <span><code>011</code></span>?</p></li>
<li><p>What happens if you have two values with no operator between them?</p></li>

<h1 id="variables-expressions-and-statements">Variables, expressions and statements</h1>
<p>One of the most powerful features of a programming language is the ability to manipulate <span><strong>variables</strong></span>. A variable is a name that refers to a value.</p>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>Assignment statements</span> <span id="variables" label="variables">[variables]</span></p>
<p>An <span><strong>assignment statement</strong></span> creates a new variable and gives it a value:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; message = &#39;And now for something completely different&#39;
&gt;&gt;&gt; n = 17
&gt;&gt;&gt; pi = 3.1415926535897932</code></pre>
<p>This example makes three assignments. The first assigns a string to a new variable named <span><code>message</code></span>; the second gives the integer <span><code>17</code></span> to <span><code>n</code></span>; the third assigns the (approximate) value of <span class="math inline"><em>π</em></span> to <span><code>pi</code></span>.</p>
<p>A common way to represent variables on paper is to write the name with an arrow pointing to its value. This kind of figure is called a <span><strong>state diagram</strong></span> because it shows what state each of the variables is in (think of it as the variable’s state of mind). Figure <a href="#fig.state2" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig.state2">3.1</a> shows the result of the previous example.</p>
<figure>
<embed src="figs/state2.pdf" id="fig.state2" /><figcaption>State diagram.<span label="fig.state2"></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>Variable names</span></p>
<p>Programmers generally choose names for their variables that are meaningful—they document what the variable is used for.</p>
<p>Variable names can be as long as you like. They can contain both letters and numbers, but they can’t begin with a number. It is legal to use uppercase letters, but it is conventional to use only lower case for variables names.</p>
<p>The underscore character, <code>_</code>, can appear in a name. It is often used in names with multiple words, such as <code>your_name</code> or <code>airspeed_of_unladen_swallow</code>.</p>
<p>If you give a variable an illegal name, you get a syntax error:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; 76trombones = &#39;big parade&#39;
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
&gt;&gt;&gt; more@ = 1000000
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
&gt;&gt;&gt; class = &#39;Advanced Theoretical Zymurgy&#39;
SyntaxError: invalid syntax</code></pre>
<p><span><code>76trombones</code></span> is illegal because it begins with a number. <span><code>more@</code></span> is illegal because it contains an illegal character, <span><code> @</code></span>. But what’s wrong with <span><code>class</code></span>?</p>
<p>It turns out that <span><code>class</code></span> is one of Python’s <span><strong>keywords</strong></span>. The interpreter uses keywords to recognize the structure of the program, and they cannot be used as variable names.</p>
<p>Python 3 has these keywords:</p>
<pre><code>False      class      finally    is         return
None       continue   for        lambda     try
True       def        from       nonlocal   while
and        del        global     not        with
as         elif       if         or         yield
assert     else       import     pass
break      except     in         raise</code></pre>
<p>You don’t have to memorize this list. In most development environments, keywords are displayed in a different color; if you try to use one as a variable name, you’ll know.</p>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>Expressions and statements</span></p>
<p>An <span><strong>expression</strong></span> is a combination of values, variables, and operators. A value all by itself is considered an expression, and so is a variable, so the following are all legal expressions:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; 42
42
&gt;&gt;&gt; n
17
&gt;&gt;&gt; n + 25
42</code></pre>
<p>When you type an expression at the prompt, the interpreter <span><strong>evaluates</strong></span> it, which means that it finds the value of the expression. In this example, <span><code>n</code></span> has the value 17 and <span><code>n + 25</code></span> has the value 42.</p>
<p>A <span><strong>statement</strong></span> is a unit of code that has an effect, like creating a variable or displaying a value.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; n = 17
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(n)</code></pre>
<p>The first line is an assignment statement that gives a value to <span><code>n</code></span>. The second line is a print statement that displays the value of <span><code>n</code></span>.</p>
<p>When you type a statement, the interpreter <span><strong>executes</strong></span> it, which means that it does whatever the statement says. In general, statements don’t have values.</p>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>Script mode</span></p>
<p>So far we have run Python in <span><strong>interactive mode</strong></span>, which means that you interact directly with the interpreter. Interactive mode is a good way to get started, but if you are working with more than a few lines of code, it can be clumsy.</p>
<p>The alternative is to save code in a file called a <span><strong>script</strong></span> and then run the interpreter in <span><strong>script mode</strong></span> to execute the script. By convention, Python scripts have names that end with <span><code>.py</code></span>.</p>
<p>If you know how to create and run a script on your computer, you are ready to go. Otherwise I recommend using PythonAnywhere again. I have posted instructions for running in script mode at <a href="http://tinyurl.com/thinkpython2e">http://tinyurl.com/thinkpython2e</a>.</p>
<p>Because Python provides both modes, you can test bits of code in interactive mode before you put them in a script. But there are differences between interactive mode and script mode that can be confusing.</p>
<p>For example, if you are using Python as a calculator, you might type</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; miles = 26.2
&gt;&gt;&gt; miles * 1.61
42.182</code></pre>
<p>The first line assigns a value to <span><code>miles</code></span>, but it has no visible effect. The second line is an expression, so the interpreter evaluates it and displays the result. It turns out that a marathon is about 42 kilometers.</p>
<p>But if you type the same code into a script and run it, you get no output at all. In script mode an expression, all by itself, has no visible effect. Python evaluates the expression, but it doesn’t display the result. To display the result, you need a <span><code>print</code></span> statement like this:</p>
<pre><code>miles = 26.2
print(miles * 1.61)</code></pre>
<p>This behavior can be confusing at first. To check your understanding, type the following statements in the Python interpreter and see what they do:</p>
<pre><code>5
x = 5
x + 1</code></pre>
<p>Now put the same statements in a script and run it. What is the output? Modify the script by transforming each expression into a print statement and then run it again.</p>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>Order of operations</span></p>
<p>When an expression contains more than one operator, the order of evaluation depends on the <span><strong>order of operations</strong></span>. For mathematical operators, Python follows mathematical convention. The acronym <span><strong>PEMDAS</strong></span> is a useful way to remember the rules:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span><strong>P</strong></span>arentheses have the highest precedence and can be used to force an expression to evaluate in the order you want. Since expressions in parentheses are evaluated first, <span><code>2 * (3-1)</code></span> is 4, and <span><code>(1+1)**(5-2)</code></span> is 8. You can also use parentheses to make an expression easier to read, as in <span><code>(minute * 100) / 60</code></span>, even if it doesn’t change the result.</p></li>
<li><p><span><strong>E</strong></span>xponentiation has the next highest precedence, so <span><code>1 + 2**3</code></span> is 9, not 27, and <span><code>2 * 3**2</code></span> is 18, not 36.</p></li>
<li><p><span><strong>M</strong></span>ultiplication and <span><strong>D</strong></span>ivision have higher precedence than <span><strong>A</strong></span>ddition and <span><strong>S</strong></span>ubtraction. So <span><code>2*3-1</code></span> is 5, not 4, and <span><code>6+4/2</code></span> is 8, not 5.</p></li>
<li><p>Operators with the same precedence are evaluated from left to right (except exponentiation). So in the expression <span><code>degrees / 2 * pi</code></span>, the division happens first and the result is multiplied by <span><code>pi</code></span>. To divide by <span class="math inline">2<em>π</em></span>, you can use parentheses or write <span><code>degrees / 2 / pi</code></span>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>I don’t work very hard to remember the precedence of operators. If I can’t tell by looking at the expression, I use parentheses to make it obvious.</p>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>String operations</span></p>
<p>In general, you can’t perform mathematical operations on strings, even if the strings look like numbers, so the following are illegal:</p>
<pre><code>&#39;chinese&#39;-&#39;food&#39;    &#39;eggs&#39;/&#39;easy&#39;    &#39;third&#39;*&#39;a charm&#39;</code></pre>
<p>But there are two exceptions, <span><code>+</code></span> and <span><code></code></span>.</p>
<p>The <span><code>+</code></span> operator performs <span><strong>string concatenation</strong></span>, which means it joins the strings by linking them end-to-end. For example:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; first = &#39;throat&#39;
&gt;&gt;&gt; second = &#39;warbler&#39;
&gt;&gt;&gt; first + second
throatwarbler</code></pre>
<p>The <span><code></code></span> operator also works on strings; it performs repetition. For example, <code>'Spam'*3</code> is <code>'SpamSpamSpam'</code>. If one of the values is a string, the other has to be an integer.</p>
<p>This use of <span><code>+</code></span> and <span><code></code></span> makes sense by analogy with addition and multiplication. Just as <span><code>4*3</code></span> is equivalent to <span><code>4+4+4</code></span>, we expect <code>'Spam'*3</code> to be the same as <code>'Spam'+'Spam'+'Spam'</code>, and it is. On the other hand, there is a significant way in which string concatenation and repetition are different from integer addition and multiplication. Can you think of a property that addition has that string concatenation does not?</p>

<p>As programs get bigger and more complicated, they get more difficult to read. Formal languages are dense, and it is often difficult to look at a piece of code and figure out what it is doing, or why.</p>
<p>For this reason, it is a good idea to add notes to your programs to explain in natural language what the program is doing. These notes are called <span><strong>comments</strong></span>, and they start with the <code>#</code> symbol:</p>
<pre><code># compute the percentage of the hour that has elapsed
percentage = (minute * 100) / 60</code></pre>
<p>In this case, the comment appears on a line by itself. You can also put comments at the end of a line:</p>
<pre><code>percentage = (minute * 100) / 60     # percentage of an hour</code></pre>
<p>Everything from the <span><code>#</code></span> to the end of the line is ignored—it has no effect on the execution of the program.</p>
<p>Comments are most useful when they document non-obvious features of the code. It is reasonable to assume that the reader can figure out <span><em>what</em></span> the code does; it is more useful to explain <span><em>why</em></span>.</p>
<p>This comment is redundant with the code and useless:</p>
<pre><code>v = 5     # assign 5 to v</code></pre>
<p>This comment contains useful information that is not in the code:</p>
<pre><code>v = 5     # velocity in meters/second. </code></pre>
<p>Good variable names can reduce the need for comments, but long names can make complex expressions hard to read, so there is a tradeoff.</p>

<p>Three kinds of errors can occur in a program: syntax errors, runtime errors, and semantic errors. It is useful to distinguish between them in order to track them down more quickly.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Syntax error:</dt>
<dd><p>“Syntax” refers to the structure of a program and the rules about that structure. For example, parentheses have to come in matching pairs, so <span><code>(1 + 2)</code></span> is legal, but <span><code>8)</code></span> is a <span><strong>syntax error</strong></span>.</p>
<p>If there is a syntax error anywhere in your program, Python displays an error message and quits, and you will not be able to run the program. During the first few weeks of your programming career, you might spend a lot of time tracking down syntax errors. As you gain experience, you will make fewer errors and find them faster.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Runtime error:</dt>
<dd><p>The second type of error is a runtime error, so called because the error does not appear until after the program has started running. These errors are also called <span><strong>exceptions</strong></span> because they usually indicate that something exceptional (and bad) has happened.</p>
<p>Runtime errors are rare in the simple programs you will see in the first few chapters, so it might be a while before you encounter one.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Semantic error:</dt>
<dd><p>The third type of error is “semantic”, which means related to meaning. If there is a semantic error in your program, it will run without generating error messages, but it will not do the right thing. It will do something else. Specifically, it will do what you told it to do.</p>
<p>Identifying semantic errors can be tricky because it requires you to work backward by looking at the output of the program and trying to figure out what it is doing.</p>

<p>Repeating my advice from the previous chapter, whenever you learn a new feature, you should try it out in interactive mode and make errors on purpose to see what goes wrong.</p>

<h1 id="funcchap">Functions</h1>
<p>In the context of programming, a <span><strong>function</strong></span> is a named sequence of statements that performs a computation. When you define a function, you specify the name and the sequence of statements. Later, you can “call” the function by name.</p>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>Function calls</span> <span id="functionchap" label="functionchap">[functionchap]</span></p>
<p>We have already seen one example of a <span><strong>function call</strong></span>:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; type(42)
&lt;class &#39;int&#39;&gt;</code></pre>
<p>The name of the function is <span><code>type</code></span>. The expression in parentheses is called the <span><strong>argument</strong></span> of the function. The result, for this function, is the type of the argument.</p>
<p>It is common to say that a function “takes” an argument and “returns” a result. The result is also called the <span><strong>return value</strong></span>.</p>
<p>Python provides functions that convert values from one type to another. The <span><code>int</code></span> function takes any value and converts it to an integer, if it can, or complains otherwise:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; int(&#39;32&#39;)
32
&gt;&gt;&gt; int(&#39;Hello&#39;)
ValueError: invalid literal for int(): Hello</code></pre>
<p><span><code>int</code></span> can convert floating-point values to integers, but it doesn’t round off; it chops off the fraction part:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; int(3.99999)
3
&gt;&gt;&gt; int(-2.3)
-2</code></pre>
<p><span><code>float</code></span> converts integers and strings to floating-point numbers:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; float(32)
32.0
&gt;&gt;&gt; float(&#39;3.14159&#39;)
3.14159</code></pre>
<p>Finally, <span><code>str</code></span> converts its argument to a string:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; str(32)
&#39;32&#39;
&gt;&gt;&gt; str(3.14159)
&#39;3.14159&#39;</code></pre>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>Math functions</span></p>
<p>Python has a math module that provides most of the familiar mathematical functions. A <span><strong>module</strong></span> is a file that contains a collection of related functions.</p>
<p>Before we can use the functions in a module, we have to import it with an <span><strong>import statement</strong></span>:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import math</code></pre>
<p>This statement creates a <span><strong>module object</strong></span> named math. If you display the module object, you get some information about it:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; math
&lt;module &#39;math&#39; (built-in)&gt;</code></pre>
<p>The module object contains the functions and variables defined in the module. To access one of the functions, you have to specify the name of the module and the name of the function, separated by a dot (also known as a period). This format is called <span><strong>dot notation</strong></span>.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; ratio = signal_power / noise_power
&gt;&gt;&gt; decibels = 10 * math.log10(ratio)

&gt;&gt;&gt; radians = 0.7
&gt;&gt;&gt; height = math.sin(radians)</code></pre>
<p>The first example uses <code>math.log10</code> to compute a signal-to-noise ratio in decibels (assuming that <code>signal_power</code> and <code>noise_power</code> are defined). The math module also provides <span><code>log</code></span>, which computes logarithms base <span><code>e</code></span>.</p>
<p>The second example finds the sine of <span><code>radians</code></span>. The variable name <span><code>radians</code></span> is a hint that <span><code>sin</code></span> and the other trigonometric functions (<span><code>cos</code></span>, <span><code>tan</code></span>, etc.) take arguments in radians. To convert from degrees to radians, divide by 180 and multiply by <span class="math inline"><em>π</em></span>:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; degrees = 45
&gt;&gt;&gt; radians = degrees / 180.0 * math.pi
&gt;&gt;&gt; math.sin(radians)
0.707106781187</code></pre>
<p>The expression <span><code>math.pi</code></span> gets the variable <span><code>pi</code></span> from the math module. Its value is a floating-point approximation of <span class="math inline"><em>π</em></span>, accurate to about 15 digits.</p>
<p>If you know trigonometry, you can check the previous result by comparing it to the square root of two, divided by two:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; math.sqrt(2) / 2.0
0.707106781187</code></pre>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>Composition</span></p>
<p>So far, we have looked at the elements of a program—variables, expressions, and statements—in isolation, without talking about how to combine them.</p>
<p>One of the most useful features of programming languages is their ability to take small building blocks and <span><strong>compose</strong></span> them. For example, the argument of a function can be any kind of expression, including arithmetic operators:</p>
<pre><code>x = math.sin(degrees / 360.0 * 2 * math.pi)</code></pre>
<p>And even function calls:</p>
<pre><code>x = math.exp(math.log(x+1))</code></pre>
<p>Almost anywhere you can put a value, you can put an arbitrary expression, with one exception: the left side of an assignment statement has to be a variable name. Any other expression on the left side is a syntax error (we will see exceptions to this rule later).</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; minutes = hours * 60                 # right
&gt;&gt;&gt; hours * 60 = minutes                 # wrong!
SyntaxError: can&#39;t assign to operator</code></pre>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>Adding new functions</span></p>
<p>So far, we have only been using the functions that come with Python, but it is also possible to add new functions. A <span><strong>function definition</strong></span> specifies the name of a new function and the sequence of statements that run when the function is called.</p>
<p>Here is an example:</p>
<pre><code>def print_lyrics():
    print(&quot;I&#39;m a lumberjack, and I&#39;m okay.&quot;)
    print(&quot;I sleep all night and I work all day.&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><span><code>def</code></span> is a keyword that indicates that this is a function definition. The name of the function is <code>print_lyrics</code>. The rules for function names are the same as for variable names: letters, numbers and underscore are legal, but the first character can’t be a number. You can’t use a keyword as the name of a function, and you should avoid having a variable and a function with the same name.</p>
<p>The empty parentheses after the name indicate that this function doesn’t take any arguments.</p>
<p>The first line of the function definition is called the <span><strong>header</strong></span>; the rest is called the <span><strong>body</strong></span>. The header has to end with a colon and the body has to be indented. By convention, indentation is always four spaces. The body can contain any number of statements.</p>
<p>The strings in the print statements are enclosed in double quotes. Single quotes and double quotes do the same thing; most people use single quotes except in cases like this where a single quote (which is also an apostrophe) appears in the string.</p>
<p>All quotation marks (single and double) must be “straight quotes”, usually located next to Enter on the keyboard. “Curly quotes”, like the ones in this sentence, are not legal in Python.</p>
<p>If you type a function definition in interactive mode, the interpreter prints dots (<span><code>...</code></span>) to let you know that the definition isn’t complete:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; def print_lyrics():
...     print(&quot;I&#39;m a lumberjack, and I&#39;m okay.&quot;)
...     print(&quot;I sleep all night and I work all day.&quot;)
...</code></pre>
<p>To end the function, you have to enter an empty line.</p>
<p>Defining a function creates a <span><strong>function object</strong></span>, which has type <code>function</code>:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; print(print_lyrics)
&lt;function print_lyrics at 0xb7e99e9c&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; type(print_lyrics)
&lt;class &#39;function&#39;&gt;</code></pre>
<p>The syntax for calling the new function is the same as for built-in functions:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; print_lyrics()
I&#39;m a lumberjack, and I&#39;m okay.
I sleep all night and I work all day.</code></pre>
<p>Once you have defined a function, you can use it inside another function. For example, to repeat the previous refrain, we could write a function called <code>repeat_lyrics</code>:</p>
<pre><code>def repeat_lyrics():
    print_lyrics()
    print_lyrics()</code></pre>
<p>And then call <code>repeat_lyrics</code>:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; repeat_lyrics()
I&#39;m a lumberjack, and I&#39;m okay.
I sleep all night and I work all day.
I&#39;m a lumberjack, and I&#39;m okay.
I sleep all night and I work all day.</code></pre>
<p>But that’s not really how the song goes.</p>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>Definitions and uses</span></p>
<p>Pulling together the code fragments from the previous section, the whole program looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>def print_lyrics():
    print(&quot;I&#39;m a lumberjack, and I&#39;m okay.&quot;)
    print(&quot;I sleep all night and I work all day.&quot;)

def repeat_lyrics():
    print_lyrics()
    print_lyrics()

repeat_lyrics()</code></pre>
<p>This program contains two function definitions: <code>print_lyrics</code> and <code>repeat_lyrics</code>. Function definitions get executed just like other statements, but the effect is to create function objects. The statements inside the function do not run until the function is called, and the function definition generates no output.</p>
<p>As you might expect, you have to create a function before you can run it. In other words, the function definition has to run before the function gets called.</p>
<p>As an exercise, move the last line of this program to the top, so the function call appears before the definitions. Run the program and see what error message you get.</p>
<p>Now move the function call back to the bottom and move the definition of <code>print_lyrics</code> after the definition of <code>repeat_lyrics</code>. What happens when you run this program?</p>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>Flow of execution</span></p>
<p>To ensure that a function is defined before its first use, you have to know the order statements run in, which is called the <span><strong>flow of execution</strong></span>.</p>
<p>Execution always begins at the first statement of the program. Statements are run one at a time, in order from top to bottom.</p>
<p>Function definitions do not alter the flow of execution of the program, but remember that statements inside the function don’t run until the function is called.</p>
<p>A function call is like a detour in the flow of execution. Instead of going to the next statement, the flow jumps to the body of the function, runs the statements there, and then comes back to pick up where it left off.</p>
<p>That sounds simple enough, until you remember that one function can call another. While in the middle of one function, the program might have to run the statements in another function. Then, while running that new function, the program might have to run yet another function!</p>
<p>Fortunately, Python is good at keeping track of where it is, so each time a function completes, the program picks up where it left off in the function that called it. When it gets to the end of the program, it terminates.</p>
<p>In summary, when you read a program, you don’t always want to read from top to bottom. Sometimes it makes more sense if you follow the flow of execution.</p>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>Parameters and arguments</span> <span id="parameters" label="parameters">[parameters]</span></p>
<p>Some of the functions we have seen require arguments. For example, when you call <span><code>math.sin</code></span> you pass a number as an argument. Some functions take more than one argument: <span><code>math.pow</code></span> takes two, the base and the exponent.</p>
<p>Inside the function, the arguments are assigned to variables called <span><strong>parameters</strong></span>. Here is a definition for a function that takes an argument:</p>
<pre><code>def print_twice(bruce):
    print(bruce)
    print(bruce)</code></pre>
<p>This function assigns the argument to a parameter named <span><code>bruce</code></span>. When the function is called, it prints the value of the parameter (whatever it is) twice.</p>
<p>This function works with any value that can be printed.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; print_twice(&#39;Spam&#39;)
Spam
Spam
&gt;&gt;&gt; print_twice(42)
42
42
&gt;&gt;&gt; print_twice(math.pi)
3.14159265359
3.14159265359</code></pre>
<p>The same rules of composition that apply to built-in functions also apply to programmer-defined functions, so we can use any kind of expression as an argument for <code>print_twice</code>:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; print_twice(&#39;Spam &#39;*4)
Spam Spam Spam Spam
Spam Spam Spam Spam
&gt;&gt;&gt; print_twice(math.cos(math.pi))
-1.0
-1.0</code></pre>
<p>The argument is evaluated before the function is called, so in the examples the expressions <code>'Spam '*4</code> and <span><code>math.cos(math.pi)</code></span> are only evaluated once.</p>
<p>You can also use a variable as an argument:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; michael = &#39;Eric, the half a bee.&#39;
&gt;&gt;&gt; print_twice(michael)
Eric, the half a bee.
Eric, the half a bee.</code></pre>
<p>The name of the variable we pass as an argument (<span><code>michael</code></span>) has nothing to do with the name of the parameter (<span><code>bruce</code></span>). It doesn’t matter what the value was called back home (in the caller); here in <code>print_twice</code>, we call everybody <span><code>bruce</code></span>.</p>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>Variables and parameters are local</span></p>
<p>When you create a variable inside a function, it is <span><strong>local</strong></span>, which means that it only exists inside the function. For example:</p>
<pre><code>def cat_twice(part1, part2):
    cat = part1 + part2
    print_twice(cat)</code></pre>
<p>This function takes two arguments, concatenates them, and prints the result twice. Here is an example that uses it:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; line1 = &#39;Bing tiddle &#39;
&gt;&gt;&gt; line2 = &#39;tiddle bang.&#39;
&gt;&gt;&gt; cat_twice(line1, line2)
Bing tiddle tiddle bang.
Bing tiddle tiddle bang.</code></pre>
<p>When <code>cat_twice</code> terminates, the variable <span><code>cat</code></span> is destroyed. If we try to print it, we get an exception:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; print(cat)
NameError: name &#39;cat&#39; is not defined</code></pre>
<p>Parameters are also local. For example, outside <code>print_twice</code>, there is no such thing as <span><code>bruce</code></span>.</p>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>Stack diagrams</span> <span id="stackdiagram" label="stackdiagram">[stackdiagram]</span></p>
<p>To keep track of which variables can be used where, it is sometimes useful to draw a <span><strong>stack diagram</strong></span>. Like state diagrams, stack diagrams show the value of each variable, but they also show the function each variable belongs to.</p>
<p>Each function is represented by a <span><strong>frame</strong></span>. A frame is a box with the name of a function beside it and the parameters and variables of the function inside it. The stack diagram for the previous example is shown in Figure <a href="#fig.stack" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig.stack">4.1</a>.</p>
<figure>
<embed src="figs/stack.pdf" id="fig.stack" /><figcaption>Stack diagram.<span label="fig.stack"></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The frames are arranged in a stack that indicates which function called which, and so on. In this example, <code>print_twice</code> was called by <code>cat_twice</code>, and <code>cat_twice</code> was called by <code>__main__</code>, which is a special name for the topmost frame. When you create a variable outside of any function, it belongs to <code>__main__</code>.</p>
<p>Each parameter refers to the same value as its corresponding argument. So, <span><code>part1</code></span> has the same value as <span><code>line1</code></span>, <span><code>part2</code></span> has the same value as <span><code>line2</code></span>, and <span><code>bruce</code></span> has the same value as <span><code>cat</code></span>.</p>
<p>If an error occurs during a function call, Python prints the name of the function, the name of the function that called it, and the name of the function that called <span><em>that</em></span>, all the way back to <code>__main__</code>.</p>
<p>For example, if you try to access <span><code>cat</code></span> from within <code>print_twice</code>, you get a <span><code>NameError</code></span>:</p>
<pre><code>Traceback (innermost last):
  File &quot;test.py&quot;, line 13, in __main__
    cat_twice(line1, line2)
  File &quot;test.py&quot;, line 5, in cat_twice
    print_twice(cat)

<p>This list of functions is called a <span><strong>traceback</strong></span>. It tells you what program file the error occurred in, and what line, and what functions were executing at the time. It also shows the line of code that caused the error.</p>
<p>The order of the functions in the traceback is the same as the order of the frames in the stack diagram. The function that is currently running is at the bottom.</p>

<p>Some of the functions we have used, such as the math functions, return results; for lack of a better name, I call them <span><strong>fruitful functions</strong></span>. Other functions, like <code>print_twice</code>, perform an action but don’t return a value. They are called <span><strong>void functions</strong></span>.</p>
<p>When you call a fruitful function, you almost always want to do something with the result; for example, you might assign it to a variable or use it as part of an expression:</p>
<pre><code>x = math.cos(radians)
golden = (math.sqrt(5) + 1) / 2</code></pre>
<p>When you call a function in interactive mode, Python displays the result:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; math.sqrt(5)
2.2360679774997898</code></pre>
<p>But in a script, if you call a fruitful function all by itself, the return value is lost forever!</p>
<pre><code>math.sqrt(5)</code></pre>
<p>This script computes the square root of 5, but since it doesn’t store or display the result, it is not very useful.</p>
<p>Void functions might display something on the screen or have some other effect, but they don’t have a return value. If you assign the result to a variable, you get a special value called <span><code>None</code></span>.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; result = print_twice(&#39;Bing&#39;)
Bing
Bing
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(result)
None</code></pre>
<p>The value <span><code>None</code></span> is not the same as the string <code>'None'</code>. It is a special value that has its own type:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; type(None)
&lt;class &#39;NoneType&#39;&gt;</code></pre>
<p>The functions we have written so far are all void. We will start writing fruitful functions in a few chapters.</p>

<p>It may not be clear why it is worth the trouble to divide a program into functions. There are several reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Creating a new function gives you an opportunity to name a group of statements, which makes your program easier to read and debug.</p></li>
<li><p>Functions can make a program smaller by eliminating repetitive code. Later, if you make a change, you only have to make it in one place.</p></li>
<li><p>Dividing a long program into functions allows you to debug the parts one at a time and then assemble them into a working whole.</p></li>
<li><p>Well-designed functions are often useful for many programs. Once you write and debug one, you can reuse it.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>Debugging</span></p>
<p>One of the most important skills you will acquire is debugging. Although it can be frustrating, debugging is one of the most intellectually rich, challenging, and interesting parts of programming.</p>
<p>In some ways debugging is like detective work. You are confronted with clues and you have to infer the processes and events that led to the results you see.</p>
<p>Debugging is also like an experimental science. Once you have an idea about what is going wrong, you modify your program and try again. If your hypothesis was correct, you can predict the result of the modification, and you take a step closer to a working program. If your hypothesis was wrong, you have to come up with a new one. As Sherlock Holmes pointed out, “When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.” (A. Conan Doyle, <span><em>The Sign of Four</em></span>)</p>
<p>For some people, programming and debugging are the same thing. That is, programming is the process of gradually debugging a program until it does what you want. The idea is that you should start with a working program and make small modifications, debugging them as you go.</p>
<p>For example, Linux is an operating system that contains millions of lines of code, but it started out as a simple program Linus Torvalds used to explore the Intel 80386 chip. According to Larry Greenfield, “One of Linus’s earlier projects was a program that would switch between printing AAAA and BBBB. This later evolved to Linux.” (<span><em>The Linux Users’ Guide</em></span> Beta Version 1).</p>

<p>Write a function named <code>right_justify</code> that takes a string named <span><code>s</code></span> as a parameter and prints the string with enough leading spaces so that the last letter of the string is in column 70 of the display.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; right_justify(&#39;monty&#39;)
                                                                 monty</code></pre>
<p>Hint: Use string concatenation and repetition. Also, Python provides a built-in function called <span><code>len</code></span> that returns the length of a string, so the value of <code>len('monty')</code> is 5.</p>
<p>A function object is a value you can assign to a variable or pass as an argument. For example, <code>do_twice</code> is a function that takes a function object as an argument and calls it twice:</p>
<pre><code>def do_twice(f):
    f()
    f()</code></pre>
<p>Here’s an example that uses <code>do_twice</code> to call a function named <code>print_spam</code> twice.</p>
<pre><code>def print_spam():
    print(&#39;spam&#39;)

do_twice(print_spam)</code></pre>
<ol>
<li><p>Type this example into a script and test it.</p></li>
<li><p>Modify <code>do_twice</code> so that it takes two arguments, a function object and a value, and calls the function twice, passing the value as an argument.</p></li>
<li><p>Copy the definition of <code>print_twice</code> from earlier in this chapter to your script.</p></li>
<li><p>Use the modified version of <code>do_twice</code> to call <code>print_twice</code> twice, passing <code>'spam'</code> as an argument.</p></li>
<li><p>Define a new function called <code>do_four</code> that takes a function object and a value and calls the function four times, passing the value as a parameter. There should be only two statements in the body of this function, not four.</p></li>

<p>Note: This exercise should be done using only the statements and other features we have learned so far.</p>

<li><p>Write a function that draws a grid like the following:</p>

+ - - - - + - - - - +</code></pre>
<p>Hint: to print more than one value on a line, you can print a comma-separated sequence of values:</p>
<pre><code>print(&#39;+&#39;, &#39;-&#39;)</code></pre>
<p>By default, <span><code>print</code></span> advances to the next line, but you can override that behavior and put a space at the end, like this:</p>
<pre><code>print(&#39;+&#39;, end=&#39; &#39;)
print(&#39;-&#39;)</code></pre>
<p>The output of these statements is <code>'+ -'</code> on the same line. The output from the next print statement would begin on the next line.</p></li>

<h1 id="turtlechap">Case study: interface design</h1>
<p>This chapter presents a case study that demonstrates a process for designing functions that work together.</p>
<p>It introduces the <span><code>turtle</code></span> module, which allows you to create images using turtle graphics. The <span><code>turtle</code></span> module is included in most Python installations, but if you are running Python using PythonAnywhere, you won’t be able to run the turtle examples (at least you couldn’t when I wrote this).</p>
<p>If you have already installed Python on your computer, you should be able to run the examples. Otherwise, now is a good time to install. I have posted instructions at <a href="http://tinyurl.com/thinkpython2e">http://tinyurl.com/thinkpython2e</a>.</p>
<p>Code examples from this chapter are available from <a href="http://thinkpython2.com/code/polygon.py">http://thinkpython2.com/code/polygon.py</a>.</p>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>The turtle module</span> <span id="turtle" label="turtle">[turtle]</span></p>
<p>To check whether you have the <span><code>turtle</code></span> module, open the Python interpreter and type</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import turtle
&gt;&gt;&gt; bob = turtle.Turtle()</code></pre>
<p>When you run this code, it should create a new window with small arrow that represents the turtle. Close the window.</p>
<p>Create a file named <span><code>mypolygon.py</code></span> and type in the following code:</p>
<pre><code>import turtle
bob = turtle.Turtle()
print(bob)
turtle.mainloop()</code></pre>
<p>The <span><code>turtle</code></span> module (with a lowercase ’t’) provides a function called <span><code>Turtle</code></span> (with an uppercase ’T’) that creates a Turtle object, which we assign to a variable named <span><code>bob</code></span>. Printing <span><code>bob</code></span> displays something like:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;turtle.Turtle object at 0xb7bfbf4c&gt;</code></pre>
<p>This means that <span><code>bob</code></span> refers to an object with type <span><code>Turtle</code></span> as defined in module <span><code>turtle</code></span>.</p>
<p><code>mainloop</code> tells the window to wait for the user to do something, although in this case there’s not much for the user to do except close the window.</p>
<p>Once you create a Turtle, you can call a <span><strong>method</strong></span> to move it around the window. A method is similar to a function, but it uses slightly different syntax. For example, to move the turtle forward:</p>
<pre><code>bob.fd(100)</code></pre>
<p>The method, <span><code>fd</code></span>, is associated with the turtle object we’re calling <span><code>bob</code></span>. Calling a method is like making a request: you are asking <span><code>bob</code></span> to move forward.</p>
<p>The argument of <span><code>fd</code></span> is a distance in pixels, so the actual size depends on your display.</p>
<p>Other methods you can call on a Turtle are <span><code>bk</code></span> to move backward, <span><code>lt</code></span> for left turn, and <span><code>rt</code></span> right turn. The argument for <span><code>lt</code></span> and <span><code>rt</code></span> is an angle in degrees.</p>
<p>Also, each Turtle is holding a pen, which is either down or up; if the pen is down, the Turtle leaves a trail when it moves. The methods <span><code>pu</code></span> and <span><code>pd</code></span> stand for “pen up” and “pen down”.</p>
<p>To draw a right angle, add these lines to the program (after creating <span><code>bob</code></span> and before calling <code>mainloop</code>):</p>
<pre><code>bob.fd(100)
bob.lt(90)
bob.fd(100)</code></pre>
<p>When you run this program, you should see <span><code>bob</code></span> move east and then north, leaving two line segments behind.</p>
<p>Now modify the program to draw a square. Don’t go on until you’ve got it working!</p>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>Simple repetition</span> <span id="repetition" label="repetition">[repetition]</span></p>
<p>Chances are you wrote something like this:</p>
<pre><code>bob.fd(100)
bob.lt(90)

bob.fd(100)
bob.lt(90)

bob.fd(100)
bob.lt(90)

bob.fd(100)</code></pre>
<p>We can do the same thing more concisely with a <span><code>for</code></span> statement. Add this example to <span><code>mypolygon.py</code></span> and run it again:</p>
<pre><code>for i in range(4):
    print(&#39;Hello!&#39;)</code></pre>
<p>You should see something like this:</p>
<pre><code>Hello!
Hello!
Hello!
Hello!</code></pre>
<p>This is the simplest use of the <span><code>for</code></span> statement; we will see more later. But that should be enough to let you rewrite your square-drawing program. Don’t go on until you do.</p>
<p>Here is a <span><code>for</code></span> statement that draws a square:</p>
<pre><code>for i in range(4):
    bob.fd(100)
    bob.lt(90)</code></pre>
<p>The syntax of a <span><code>for</code></span> statement is similar to a function definition. It has a header that ends with a colon and an indented body. The body can contain any number of statements.</p>
<p>A <span><code>for</code></span> statement is also called a <span><strong>loop</strong></span> because the flow of execution runs through the body and then loops back to the top. In this case, it runs the body four times.</p>
<p>This version is actually a little different from the previous square-drawing code because it makes another turn after drawing the last side of the square. The extra turn takes more time, but it simplifies the code if we do the same thing every time through the loop. This version also has the effect of leaving the turtle back in the starting position, facing in the starting direction.</p>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>Exercises</span></p>
<p>The following is a series of exercises using the <span><code>turtle</code></span> module. They are meant to be fun, but they have a point, too. While you are working on them, think about what the point is.</p>
<p>The following sections have solutions to the exercises, so don’t look until you have finished (or at least tried).</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Write a function called <span><code>square</code></span> that takes a parameter named <span><code>t</code></span>, which is a turtle. It should use the turtle to draw a square.</p>
<p>Write a function call that passes <span><code>bob</code></span> as an argument to <span><code>square</code></span>, and then run the program again.</p></li>
<li><p>Add another parameter, named <span><code>length</code></span>, to <span><code>square</code></span>. Modify the body so length of the sides is <span><code>length</code></span>, and then modify the function call to provide a second argument. Run the program again. Test your program with a range of values for <span><code> length</code></span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Make a copy of <span><code>square</code></span> and change the name to <span><code> polygon</code></span>. Add another parameter named <span><code>n</code></span> and modify the body so it draws an n-sided regular polygon. Hint: The exterior angles of an n-sided regular polygon are <span class="math inline">360/<em>n</em></span> degrees.</p></li>
<li><p>Write a function called <span><code>circle</code></span> that takes a turtle, <span><code>t</code></span>, and radius, <span><code>r</code></span>, as parameters and that draws an approximate circle by calling <span><code>polygon</code></span> with an appropriate length and number of sides. Test your function with a range of values of <span><code>r</code></span>.</p>
<p>Hint: figure out the circumference of the circle and make sure that <span><code>length * n = circumference</code></span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Make a more general version of <span><code>circle</code></span> called <span><code>arc</code></span> that takes an additional parameter <span><code>angle</code></span>, which determines what fraction of a circle to draw. <span><code>angle</code></span> is in units of degrees, so when <span><code>angle=360</code></span>, <span><code>arc</code></span> should draw a complete circle.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>Encapsulation</span></p>
<p>The first exercise asks you to put your square-drawing code into a function definition and then call the function, passing the turtle as a parameter. Here is a solution:</p>
<pre><code>def square(t):
    for i in range(4):
        t.fd(100)
        t.lt(90)

square(bob)</code></pre>
<p>The innermost statements, <span><code>fd</code></span> and <span><code>lt</code></span> are indented twice to show that they are inside the <span><code>for</code></span> loop, which is inside the function definition. The next line, <span><code>square(bob)</code></span>, is flush with the left margin, which indicates the end of both the <span><code>for</code></span> loop and the function definition.</p>
<p>Inside the function, <span><code>t</code></span> refers to the same turtle <span><code>bob</code></span>, so <span><code>t.lt(90)</code></span> has the same effect as <span><code>bob.lt(90)</code></span>. In that case, why not call the parameter <span><code>bob</code></span>? The idea is that <span><code>t</code></span> can be any turtle, not just <span><code>bob</code></span>, so you could create a second turtle and pass it as an argument to <span><code>square</code></span>:</p>
<pre><code>alice = turtle.Turtle()
square(alice)</code></pre>
<p>Wrapping a piece of code up in a function is called <span> <strong>encapsulation</strong></span>. One of the benefits of encapsulation is that it attaches a name to the code, which serves as a kind of documentation. Another advantage is that if you re-use the code, it is more concise to call a function twice than to copy and paste the body!</p>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>Generalization</span></p>
<p>The next step is to add a <span><code>length</code></span> parameter to <span><code>square</code></span>. Here is a solution:</p>
<pre><code>def square(t, length):
    for i in range(4):
        t.fd(length)
        t.lt(90)

square(bob, 100)</code></pre>
<p>Adding a parameter to a function is called <span><strong>generalization</strong></span> because it makes the function more general: in the previous version, the square is always the same size; in this version it can be any size.</p>
<p>The next step is also a generalization. Instead of drawing squares, <span><code>polygon</code></span> draws regular polygons with any number of sides. Here is a solution:</p>
<pre><code>def polygon(t, n, length):
    angle = 360 / n
    for i in range(n):
        t.fd(length)
        t.lt(angle)

polygon(bob, 7, 70)</code></pre>
<p>This example draws a 7-sided polygon with side length 70.</p>
<p>If you are using Python 2, the value of <span><code>angle</code></span> might be off because of integer division. A simple solution is to compute <span><code>angle = 360.0 / n</code></span>. Because the numerator is a floating-point number, the result is floating point.</p>
<p>When a function has more than a few numeric arguments, it is easy to forget what they are, or what order they should be in. In that case it is often a good idea to include the names of the parameters in the argument list:</p>
<pre><code>polygon(bob, n=7, length=70)</code></pre>
<p>These are called <span><strong>keyword arguments</strong></span> because they include the parameter names as “keywords” (not to be confused with Python keywords like <span><code>while</code></span> and <span><code>def</code></span>).</p>
<p>This syntax makes the program more readable. It is also a reminder about how arguments and parameters work: when you call a function, the arguments are assigned to the parameters.</p>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>Interface design</span></p>
<p>The next step is to write <span><code>circle</code></span>, which takes a radius, <span><code>r</code></span>, as a parameter. Here is a simple solution that uses <span><code>polygon</code></span> to draw a 50-sided polygon:</p>
<pre><code>import math

def circle(t, r):
    circumference = 2 * math.pi * r
    n = 50
    length = circumference / n
    polygon(t, n, length)</code></pre>
<p>The first line computes the circumference of a circle with radius <span><code>r</code></span> using the formula <span class="math inline">2<em>π</em><em>r</em></span>. Since we use <span><code>math.pi</code></span>, we have to import <span><code>math</code></span>. By convention, <span><code>import</code></span> statements are usually at the beginning of the script.</p>
<p><span><code>n</code></span> is the number of line segments in our approximation of a circle, so <span><code>length</code></span> is the length of each segment. Thus, <span><code>polygon</code></span> draws a 50-sided polygon that approximates a circle with radius <span><code>r</code></span>.</p>
<p>One limitation of this solution is that <span><code>n</code></span> is a constant, which means that for very big circles, the line segments are too long, and for small circles, we waste time drawing very small segments. One solution would be to generalize the function by taking <span><code>n</code></span> as a parameter. This would give the user (whoever calls <span><code>circle</code></span>) more control, but the interface would be less clean.</p>
<p>The <span><strong>interface</strong></span> of a function is a summary of how it is used: what are the parameters? What does the function do? And what is the return value? An interface is “clean” if it allows the caller to do what they want without dealing with unnecessary details.</p>
<p>In this example, <span><code>r</code></span> belongs in the interface because it specifies the circle to be drawn. <span><code>n</code></span> is less appropriate because it pertains to the details of <span><em>how</em></span> the circle should be rendered.</p>
<p>Rather than clutter up the interface, it is better to choose an appropriate value of <span><code>n</code></span> depending on <span><code>circumference</code></span>:</p>
<pre><code>def circle(t, r):
    circumference = 2 * math.pi * r
    n = int(circumference / 3) + 3
    length = circumference / n
    polygon(t, n, length)</code></pre>
<p>Now the number of segments is an integer near <span><code>circumference/3</code></span>, so the length of each segment is approximately 3, which is small enough that the circles look good, but big enough to be efficient, and acceptable for any size circle.</p>
<p>Adding 3 to <span><code>n</code></span> guarantees that the polygon has at least 3 sides.</p>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>Refactoring</span> <span id="refactoring" label="refactoring">[refactoring]</span></p>
<p>When I wrote <span><code>circle</code></span>, I was able to re-use <span><code>polygon</code></span> because a many-sided polygon is a good approximation of a circle. But <span><code>arc</code></span> is not as cooperative; we can’t use <span><code>polygon</code></span> or <span><code>circle</code></span> to draw an arc.</p>
<p>One alternative is to start with a copy of <span><code>polygon</code></span> and transform it into <span><code>arc</code></span>. The result might look like this:</p>
<pre><code>def arc(t, r, angle):
    arc_length = 2 * math.pi * r * angle / 360
    n = int(arc_length / 3) + 1
    step_length = arc_length / n
    step_angle = angle / n
    
    for i in range(n):
        t.fd(step_length)
        t.lt(step_angle)</code></pre>
<p>The second half of this function looks like <span><code>polygon</code></span>, but we can’t re-use <span><code>polygon</code></span> without changing the interface. We could generalize <span><code>polygon</code></span> to take an angle as a third argument, but then <span><code>polygon</code></span> would no longer be an appropriate name! Instead, let’s call the more general function <span><code>polyline</code></span>:</p>
<pre><code>def polyline(t, n, length, angle):
    for i in range(n):
        t.fd(length)
        t.lt(angle)</code></pre>
<p>Now we can rewrite <span><code>polygon</code></span> and <span><code>arc</code></span> to use <span><code>polyline</code></span>:</p>
<pre><code>def polygon(t, n, length):
    angle = 360.0 / n
    polyline(t, n, length, angle)

def arc(t, r, angle):
    arc_length = 2 * math.pi * r * angle / 360
    n = int(arc_length / 3) + 1
    step_length = arc_length / n
    step_angle = float(angle) / n
    polyline(t, n, step_length, step_angle)</code></pre>
<p>Finally, we can rewrite <span><code>circle</code></span> to use <span><code>arc</code></span>:</p>
<pre><code>def circle(t, r):
    arc(t, r, 360)</code></pre>
<p>This process—rearranging a program to improve interfaces and facilitate code re-use—is called <span><strong>refactoring</strong></span>. In this case, we noticed that there was similar code in <span><code>arc</code></span> and <span><code>polygon</code></span>, so we “factored it out” into <span><code>polyline</code></span>.</p>
<p>If we had planned ahead, we might have written <span><code>polyline</code></span> first and avoided refactoring, but often you don’t know enough at the beginning of a project to design all the interfaces. Once you start coding, you understand the problem better. Sometimes refactoring is a sign that you have learned something.</p>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>A development plan</span></p>
<p>A <span><strong>development plan</strong></span> is a process for writing programs. The process we used in this case study is “encapsulation and generalization”. The steps of this process are:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Start by writing a small program with no function definitions.</p></li>
<li><p>Once you get the program working, identify a coherent piece of it, encapsulate the piece in a function and give it a name.</p></li>
<li><p>Generalize the function by adding appropriate parameters.</p></li>
<li><p>Repeat steps 1–3 until you have a set of working functions. Copy and paste working code to avoid retyping (and re-debugging).</p></li>
<li><p>Look for opportunities to improve the program by refactoring. For example, if you have similar code in several places, consider factoring it into an appropriately general function.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>This process has some drawbacks—we will see alternatives later—but it can be useful if you don’t know ahead of time how to divide the program into functions. This approach lets you design as you go along.</p>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>docstring</span> <span id="docstring" label="docstring">[docstring]</span></p>
<p>A <span><strong>docstring</strong></span> is a string at the beginning of a function that explains the interface (“doc” is short for “documentation”). Here is an example:</p>
<pre><code>def polyline(t, n, length, angle):
    &quot;&quot;&quot;Draws n line segments with the given length and
    angle (in degrees) between them.  t is a turtle.
    &quot;&quot;&quot;    
    for i in range(n):
        t.fd(length)
        t.lt(angle)</code></pre>
<p>By convention, all docstrings are triple-quoted strings, also known as multiline strings because the triple quotes allow the string to span more than one line.</p>
<p>It is terse, but it contains the essential information someone would need to use this function. It explains concisely what the function does (without getting into the details of how it does it). It explains what effect each parameter has on the behavior of the function and what type each parameter should be (if it is not obvious).</p>
<p>Writing this kind of documentation is an important part of interface design. A well-designed interface should be simple to explain; if you have a hard time explaining one of your functions, maybe the interface could be improved.</p>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>Debugging</span></p>
<p>An interface is like a contract between a function and a caller. The caller agrees to provide certain parameters and the function agrees to do certain work.</p>
<p>For example, <span><code>polyline</code></span> requires four arguments: <span><code>t</code></span> has to be a Turtle; <span><code>n</code></span> has to be an integer; <span><code>length</code></span> should be a positive number; and <span><code> angle</code></span> has to be a number, which is understood to be in degrees.</p>
<p>These requirements are called <span><strong>preconditions</strong></span> because they are supposed to be true before the function starts executing. Conversely, conditions at the end of the function are <span><strong>postconditions</strong></span>. Postconditions include the intended effect of the function (like drawing line segments) and any side effects (like moving the Turtle or making other changes).</p>
<p>Preconditions are the responsibility of the caller. If the caller violates a (properly documented!) precondition and the function doesn’t work correctly, the bug is in the caller, not the function.</p>
<p>If the preconditions are satisfied and the postconditions are not, the bug is in the function. If your pre- and postconditions are clear, they can help with debugging.</p>

<h1 id="conditionals-and-recursion">Conditionals and recursion</h1>
<p>The main topic of this chapter is the <span><code>if</code></span> statement, which executes different code depending on the state of the program. But first I want to introduce two new operators: floor division and modulus.</p>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>Floor division and modulus</span></p>
<p>The <span><strong>floor division</strong></span> operator, <code>//</code>, divides two numbers and rounds down to an integer. For example, suppose the run time of a movie is 105 minutes. You might want to know how long that is in hours. Conventional division returns a floating-point number:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; minutes = 105
&gt;&gt;&gt; minutes / 60
1.75</code></pre>
<p>But we don’t normally write hours with decimal points. Floor division returns the integer number of hours, rounding down:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; minutes = 105
&gt;&gt;&gt; hours = minutes // 60
&gt;&gt;&gt; hours
1</code></pre>
<p>To get the remainder, you could subtract off one hour in minutes:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; remainder = minutes - hours * 60
&gt;&gt;&gt; remainder
45</code></pre>
<p>An alternative is to use the <span><strong>modulus operator</strong></span>, <code>%</code>, which divides two numbers and returns the remainder.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; remainder = minutes % 60
&gt;&gt;&gt; remainder
45</code></pre>
<p>The modulus operator is more useful than it seems. For example, you can check whether one number is divisible by another—if <span><code>x % y</code></span> is zero, then <span><code>x</code></span> is divisible by <span><code>y</code></span>.</p>
<p>Also, you can extract the right-most digit or digits from a number. For example, <span><code>x % 10</code></span> yields the right-most digit of <span><code>x</code></span> (in base 10). Similarly <span><code>x % 100</code></span> yields the last two digits.</p>
<p>If you are using Python 2, division works differently. The division operator, <code>/</code>, performs floor division if both operands are integers, and floating-point division if either operand is a <span><code>float</code></span>.</p>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>Boolean expressions</span></p>
<p>A <span><strong>boolean expression</strong></span> is an expression that is either true or false. The following examples use the operator <span><code>==</code></span>, which compares two operands and produces <span><code>True</code></span> if they are equal and <span><code>False</code></span> otherwise:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; 5 == 5
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; 5 == 6
False</code></pre>
<p><span><code>True</code></span> and <span><code>False</code></span> are special values that belong to the type <span><code>bool</code></span>; they are not strings:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; type(True)
&lt;class &#39;bool&#39;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; type(False)
&lt;class &#39;bool&#39;&gt;</code></pre>
<p>The <span><code>==</code></span> operator is one of the <span><strong>relational operators</strong></span>; the others are:</p>
<pre><code>      x != y               # x is not equal to y
      x &gt; y                # x is greater than y
      x &lt; y                # x is less than y
      x &gt;= y               # x is greater than or equal to y
      x &lt;= y               # x is less than or equal to y</code></pre>
<p>Although these operations are probably familiar to you, the Python symbols are different from the mathematical symbols. A common error is to use a single equal sign (<span><code>=</code></span>) instead of a double equal sign (<span><code>==</code></span>). Remember that <span><code>=</code></span> is an assignment operator and <span><code>==</code></span> is a relational operator. There is no such thing as <span><code>=&lt;</code></span> or <span><code>=&gt;</code></span>.</p>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>Logical operators</span></p>
<p>There are three <span><strong>logical operators</strong></span>: <span><code>and</code></span>, <span><code> or</code></span>, and <span><code>not</code></span>. The semantics (meaning) of these operators is similar to their meaning in English. For example, <span><code>x &gt; 0 and x &lt; 10</code></span> is true only if <span><code>x</code></span> is greater than 0 <span><em>and</em></span> less than 10.</p>
<p><span><code>n%2 == 0 or n%3 == 0</code></span> is true if <span><em>either or both</em></span> of the conditions is true, that is, if the number is divisible by 2 <span><em>or</em></span> 3.</p>
<p>Finally, the <span><code>not</code></span> operator negates a boolean expression, so <span><code>not (x &gt; y)</code></span> is true if <span><code>x &gt; y</code></span> is false, that is, if <span><code>x</code></span> is less than or equal to <span><code>y</code></span>.</p>
<p>Strictly speaking, the operands of the logical operators should be boolean expressions, but Python is not very strict. Any nonzero number is interpreted as <span><code>True</code></span>:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; 42 and True
True</code></pre>
<p>This flexibility can be useful, but there are some subtleties to it that might be confusing. You might want to avoid it (unless you know what you are doing).</p>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>Conditional execution</span> <span id="conditional.execution" label="conditional.execution">[conditional.execution]</span></p>
<p>In order to write useful programs, we almost always need the ability to check conditions and change the behavior of the program accordingly. <span><strong>Conditional statements</strong></span> give us this ability. The simplest form is the <span><code>if</code></span> statement:</p>
<pre><code>if x &gt; 0:
    print(&#39;x is positive&#39;)</code></pre>
<p>The boolean expression after <span><code>if</code></span> is called the <span><strong>condition</strong></span>. If it is true, the indented statement runs. If not, nothing happens.</p>
<p><span><code>if</code></span> statements have the same structure as function definitions: a header followed by an indented body. Statements like this are called <span><strong>compound statements</strong></span>.</p>
<p>There is no limit on the number of statements that can appear in the body, but there has to be at least one. Occasionally, it is useful to have a body with no statements (usually as a place keeper for code you haven’t written yet). In that case, you can use the <span><code>pass</code></span> statement, which does nothing.</p>
<pre><code>if x &lt; 0:
    pass          # TODO: need to handle negative values!</code></pre>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>Alternative execution</span> <span id="alternative.execution" label="alternative.execution">[alternative.execution]</span></p>
<p>A second form of the <span><code>if</code></span> statement is “alternative execution”, in which there are two possibilities and the condition determines which one runs. The syntax looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>if x % 2 == 0:
    print(&#39;x is even&#39;)
else:
    print(&#39;x is odd&#39;)</code></pre>
<p>If the remainder when <span><code>x</code></span> is divided by 2 is 0, then we know that <span><code>x</code></span> is even, and the program displays an appropriate message. If the condition is false, the second set of statements runs. Since the condition must be true or false, exactly one of the alternatives will run. The alternatives are called <span> <strong>branches</strong></span>, because they are branches in the flow of execution.</p>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>Chained conditionals</span></p>
<p>Sometimes there are more than two possibilities and we need more than two branches. One way to express a computation like that is a <span> <strong>chained conditional</strong></span>:</p>
<pre><code>if x &lt; y:
    print(&#39;x is less than y&#39;)
elif x &gt; y:
    print(&#39;x is greater than y&#39;)
else:
    print(&#39;x and y are equal&#39;)</code></pre>
<p><span><code>elif</code></span> is an abbreviation of “else if”. Again, exactly one branch will run. There is no limit on the number of <span><code> elif</code></span> statements. If there is an <span><code>else</code></span> clause, it has to be at the end, but there doesn’t have to be one.</p>
<pre><code>if choice == &#39;a&#39;:
    draw_a()
elif choice == &#39;b&#39;:
    draw_b()
elif choice == &#39;c&#39;:
    draw_c()</code></pre>
<p>Each condition is checked in order. If the first is false, the next is checked, and so on. If one of them is true, the corresponding branch runs and the statement ends. Even if more than one condition is true, only the first true branch runs.</p>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>Nested conditionals</span></p>
<p>One conditional can also be nested within another. We could have written the example in the previous section like this:</p>
<pre><code>if x == y:
    print(&#39;x and y are equal&#39;)
else:
    if x &lt; y:
        print(&#39;x is less than y&#39;)
    else:
        print(&#39;x is greater than y&#39;)</code></pre>
<p>The outer conditional contains two branches. The first branch contains a simple statement. The second branch contains another <span><code>if</code></span> statement, which has two branches of its own. Those two branches are both simple statements, although they could have been conditional statements as well.</p>
<p>Although the indentation of the statements makes the structure apparent, <span><strong>nested conditionals</strong></span> become difficult to read very quickly. It is a good idea to avoid them when you can.</p>
<p>Logical operators often provide a way to simplify nested conditional statements. For example, we can rewrite the following code using a single conditional:</p>
<pre><code>if 0 &lt; x:
    if x &lt; 10:
        print(&#39;x is a positive single-digit number.&#39;)</code></pre>
<p>The <span><code>print</code></span> statement runs only if we make it past both conditionals, so we can get the same effect with the <span><code>and</code></span> operator:</p>
<pre><code>if 0 &lt; x and x &lt; 10:
    print(&#39;x is a positive single-digit number.&#39;)</code></pre>
<p>For this kind of condition, Python provides a more concise option:</p>
<pre><code>if 0 &lt; x &lt; 10:
    print(&#39;x is a positive single-digit number.&#39;)</code></pre>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>Recursion</span> <span id="recursion" label="recursion">[recursion]</span></p>
<p>It is legal for one function to call another; it is also legal for a function to call itself. It may not be obvious why that is a good thing, but it turns out to be one of the most magical things a program can do. For example, look at the following function:</p>
<pre><code>def countdown(n):
    if n &lt;= 0:
        print(&#39;Blastoff!&#39;)
    else:
        print(n)
        countdown(n-1)</code></pre>
<p>If <span><code>n</code></span> is 0 or negative, it outputs the word, “Blastoff!” Otherwise, it outputs <span><code>n</code></span> and then calls a function named <span><code> countdown</code></span>—itself—passing <span><code>n-1</code></span> as an argument.</p>
<p>What happens if we call this function like this?</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; countdown(3)</code></pre>
<p>The execution of <span><code>countdown</code></span> begins with <span><code>n=3</code></span>, and since <span><code>n</code></span> is greater than 0, it outputs the value 3, and then calls itself...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The execution of <span><code>countdown</code></span> begins with <span><code>n=2</code></span>, and since <span><code>n</code></span> is greater than 0, it outputs the value 2, and then calls itself...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The execution of <span><code>countdown</code></span> begins with <span><code>n=1</code></span>, and since <span><code>n</code></span> is greater than 0, it outputs the value 1, and then calls itself...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The execution of <span><code>countdown</code></span> begins with <span><code>n=0</code></span>, and since <span><code> n</code></span> is not greater than 0, it outputs the word, “Blastoff!” and then returns.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <span><code>countdown</code></span> that got <span><code>n=1</code></span> returns.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <span><code>countdown</code></span> that got <span><code>n=2</code></span> returns.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <span><code>countdown</code></span> that got <span><code>n=3</code></span> returns.</p>
<p>And then you’re back in <code>__main__</code>. So, the total output looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>3
2
1
Blastoff!</code></pre>
<p>A function that calls itself is <span><strong>recursive</strong></span>; the process of executing it is called <span><strong>recursion</strong></span>.</p>
<p>As another example, we can write a function that prints a string <span><code>n</code></span> times.</p>
<pre><code>def print_n(s, n):
    if n &lt;= 0:
        return
    print(s)
    print_n(s, n-1)</code></pre>
<p>If <span><code>n &lt;= 0</code></span> the <span><strong>return statement</strong></span> exits the function. The flow of execution immediately returns to the caller, and the remaining lines of the function don’t run.</p>
<p>The rest of the function is similar to <span><code>countdown</code></span>: it displays <span><code>s</code></span> and then calls itself to display <span><code>s</code></span> <span class="math inline"><em>n</em> − 1</span> additional times. So the number of lines of output is <span><code>1 + (n - 1)</code></span>, which adds up to <span><code>n</code></span>.</p>
<p>For simple examples like this, it is probably easier to use a <span><code> for</code></span> loop. But we will see examples later that are hard to write with a <span><code>for</code></span> loop and easy to write with recursion, so it is good to start early.</p>

<p>In Section <a href="#stackdiagram" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="stackdiagram">[stackdiagram]</a>, we used a stack diagram to represent the state of a program during a function call. The same kind of diagram can help interpret a recursive function.</p>
<p>Every time a function gets called, Python creates a frame to contain the function’s local variables and parameters. For a recursive function, there might be more than one frame on the stack at the same time.</p>
<p>Figure <a href="#fig.stack2" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig.stack2">6.1</a> shows a stack diagram for <span><code>countdown</code></span> called with <span><code>n = 3</code></span>.</p>
<figure>
<embed src="figs/stack2.pdf" id="fig.stack2" /><figcaption>Stack diagram.<span label="fig.stack2"></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>As usual, the top of the stack is the frame for <code>__main__</code>. It is empty because we did not create any variables in <code>__main__</code> or pass any arguments to it.</p>
<p>The four <span><code>countdown</code></span> frames have different values for the parameter <span><code>n</code></span>. The bottom of the stack, where <span><code>n=0</code></span>, is called the <span><strong>base case</strong></span>. It does not make a recursive call, so there are no more frames.</p>
<p>As an exercise, draw a stack diagram for <code>print_n</code> called with <code>s = 'Hello'</code> and <span><code>n=2</code></span>. Then write a function called <code>do_n</code> that takes a function object and a number, <span><code>n</code></span>, as arguments, and that calls the given function <span><code>n</code></span> times.</p>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>Infinite recursion</span></p>
<p>If a recursion never reaches a base case, it goes on making recursive calls forever, and the program never terminates. This is known as <span><strong>infinite recursion</strong></span>, and it is generally not a good idea. Here is a minimal program with an infinite recursion:</p>
<pre><code>def recurse():
    recurse()</code></pre>
<p>In most programming environments, a program with infinite recursion does not really run forever. Python reports an error message when the maximum recursion depth is reached:</p>
<pre><code>  File &quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;, line 2, in recurse
  File &quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;, line 2, in recurse
  File &quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;, line 2, in recurse
                  .   
                  .
                  .
  File &quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;, line 2, in recurse
RuntimeError: Maximum recursion depth exceeded</code></pre>
<p>This traceback is a little bigger than the one we saw in the previous chapter. When the error occurs, there are 1000 <span><code>recurse</code></span> frames on the stack!</p>
<p>If you encounter an infinite recursion by accident, review your function to confirm that there is a base case that does not make a recursive call. And if there is a base case, check whether you are guaranteed to reach it.</p>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>Keyboard input</span></p>
<p>The programs we have written so far accept no input from the user. They just do the same thing every time.</p>
<p>Python provides a built-in function called <span><code>input</code></span> that stops the program and waits for the user to type something. When the user presses <span> Return</span> or <span>Enter</span>, the program resumes and <code>input</code> returns what the user typed as a string. In Python 2, the same function is called <code>raw_input</code>.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; text = input()
What are you waiting for?
&gt;&gt;&gt; text
&#39;What are you waiting for?&#39;</code></pre>
<p>Before getting input from the user, it is a good idea to print a prompt telling the user what to type. <code>input</code> can take a prompt as an argument:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; name = input(&#39;What...is your name?\n&#39;)
What...is your name?
Arthur, King of the Britons!
&gt;&gt;&gt; name
&#39;Arthur, King of the Britons!&#39;</code></pre>
<p>The sequence <code>\n</code> at the end of the prompt represents a <span> <strong>newline</strong></span>, which is a special character that causes a line break. That’s why the user’s input appears below the prompt.</p>
<p>If you expect the user to type an integer, you can try to convert the return value to <span><code>int</code></span>:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; prompt = &#39;What...is the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow?\n&#39;
&gt;&gt;&gt; speed = input(prompt)
What...is the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow?
42
&gt;&gt;&gt; int(speed)
42</code></pre>
<p>But if the user types something other than a string of digits, you get an error:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; speed = input(prompt)
What...is the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow?
What do you mean, an African or a European swallow?
&gt;&gt;&gt; int(speed)
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10</code></pre>
<p>We will see how to handle this kind of error later.</p>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>Debugging</span> <span id="whitespace" label="whitespace">[whitespace]</span></p>
<p>When a syntax or runtime error occurs, the error message contains a lot of information, but it can be overwhelming. The most useful parts are usually:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>What kind of error it was, and</p></li>
<li><p>Where it occurred.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Syntax errors are usually easy to find, but there are a few gotchas. Whitespace errors can be tricky because spaces and tabs are invisible and we are used to ignoring them.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; x = 5
&gt;&gt;&gt;  y = 6
  File &quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;, line 1
    y = 6
    ^
IndentationError: unexpected indent</code></pre>
<p>In this example, the problem is that the second line is indented by one space. But the error message points to <span><code>y</code></span>, which is misleading. In general, error messages indicate where the problem was discovered, but the actual error might be earlier in the code, sometimes on a previous line.</p>
<p>The same is true of runtime errors. Suppose you are trying to compute a signal-to-noise ratio in decibels. The formula is <span class="math inline"><em>S</em><em>N</em><em>R</em><sub><em>d</em><em>b</em></sub> = 10log<sub>10</sub>(<em>P</em><sub><em>s</em><em>i</em><em>g</em><em>n</em><em>a</em><em>l</em></sub>/<em>P</em><sub><em>n</em><em>o</em><em>i</em><em>s</em><em>e</em></sub>)</span>. In Python, you might write something like this:</p>
<pre><code>import math
signal_power = 9
noise_power = 10
ratio = signal_power // noise_power
decibels = 10 * math.log10(ratio)
print(decibels)</code></pre>
<p>When you run this program, you get an exception:</p>
<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):
  File &quot;snr.py&quot;, line 5, in ?
    decibels = 10 * math.log10(ratio)
ValueError: math domain error</code></pre>
<p>The error message indicates line 5, but there is nothing wrong with that line. To find the real error, it might be useful to print the value of <span><code>ratio</code></span>, which turns out to be 0. The problem is in line 4, which uses floor division instead of floating-point division.</p>
<p>You should take the time to read error messages carefully, but don’t assume that everything they say is correct.</p>

<p>If you are given three sticks, you may or may not be able to arrange them in a triangle.

<h1 id="fruitchap">Fruitful functions</h1>
<p>Many of the Python functions we have used, such as the math functions, produce return values. But the functions we’ve written are all void: they have an effect, like printing a value or moving a turtle, but they don’t have a return value. In this chapter you will learn to write fruitful functions.</p>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>Return values</span></p>
<p>Calling the function generates a return value, which we usually assign to a variable or use as part of an expression.</p>
<pre><code>e = math.exp(1.0)
height = radius * math.sin(radians)</code></pre>
<p>The functions we have written so far are void. Speaking casually, they have no return value; more precisely, their return value is <span><code>None</code></span>.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we are (finally) going to write fruitful functions. The first example is <span><code>area</code></span>, which returns the area of a circle with the given radius:</p>
<pre><code>def area(radius):
    a = math.pi * radius**2
    return a</code></pre>
<p>We have seen the <span><code>return</code></span> statement before, but in a fruitful function the <span><code>return</code></span> statement includes an expression. This statement means: “Return immediately from this function and use the following expression as a return value.” The expression can be arbitrarily complicated, so we could have written this function more concisely:</p>
<pre><code>def area(radius):
    return math.pi * radius**2</code></pre>
<p>On the other hand, <span><strong>temporary variables</strong></span> like <span><code>a</code></span> can make debugging easier.</p>
<p>Sometimes it is useful to have multiple return statements, one in each branch of a conditional:</p>
<pre><code>def absolute_value(x):
    if x &lt; 0:
        return -x
    else:
        return x</code></pre>
<p>Since these <span><code>return</code></span> statements are in an alternative conditional, only one runs.</p>
<p>As soon as a return statement runs, the function terminates without executing any subsequent statements. Code that appears after a <span><code>return</code></span> statement, or any other place the flow of execution can never reach, is called <span><strong>dead code</strong></span>.</p>
<p>In a fruitful function, it is a good idea to ensure that every possible path through the program hits a <span><code>return</code></span> statement. For example:</p>
<pre><code>def absolute_value(x):
    if x &lt; 0:
        return -x
    if x &gt; 0:
        return x</code></pre>
<p>This function is incorrect because if <span><code>x</code></span> happens to be 0, neither condition is true, and the function ends without hitting a <span><code>return</code></span> statement. If the flow of execution gets to the end of a function, the return value is <span><code>None</code></span>, which is not the absolute value of 0.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; print(absolute_value(0))
None</code></pre>
<p>By the way, Python provides a built-in function called <span><code>abs</code></span> that computes absolute values.</p>
<p>As an exercise, write a <span><code>compare</code></span> function that takes two values, <span><code>x</code></span> and <span><code>y</code></span>, and returns <span><code>1</code></span> if <span><code>x &gt; y</code></span>, <span><code>0</code></span> if <span><code>x == y</code></span>, and <span><code>-1</code></span> if <span><code>x &lt; y</code></span>.</p>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>Incremental development</span> <span id="incremental.development" label="incremental.development">[incremental.development]</span></p>
<p>As you write larger functions, you might find yourself spending more time debugging.</p>
<p>To deal with increasingly complex programs, you might want to try a process called <span><strong>incremental development</strong></span>. The goal of incremental development is to avoid long debugging sessions by adding and testing only a small amount of code at a time.</p>
<p>As an example, suppose you want to find the distance between two points, given by the coordinates <span class="math inline">(<em>x</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>y</em><sub>1</sub>)</span> and <span class="math inline">(<em>x</em><sub>2</sub>, <em>y</em><sub>2</sub>)</span>. By the Pythagorean theorem, the distance is:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math display">$$\mathrm{distance} = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$$</span><br /> The first step is to consider what a <span><code>distance</code></span> function should look like in Python. In other words, what are the inputs (parameters) and what is the output (return value)?</p>
<p>In this case, the inputs are two points, which you can represent using four numbers. The return value is the distance represented by a floating-point value.</p>
<p>Immediately you can write an outline of the function:</p>
<pre><code>def distance(x1, y1, x2, y2):
    return 0.0</code></pre>
<p>Obviously, this version doesn’t compute distances; it always returns zero. But it is syntactically correct, and it runs, which means that you can test it before you make it more complicated.</p>
<p>To test the new function, call it with sample arguments:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; distance(1, 2, 4, 6)
0.0</code></pre>
<p>I chose these values so that the horizontal distance is 3 and the vertical distance is 4; that way, the result is 5, the hypotenuse of a 3-4-5 right triangle. When testing a function, it is useful to know the right answer.</p>
<p>At this point we have confirmed that the function is syntactically correct, and we can start adding code to the body. A reasonable next step is to find the differences <span class="math inline"><em>x</em><sub>2</sub> − <em>x</em><sub>1</sub></span> and <span class="math inline"><em>y</em><sub>2</sub> − <em>y</em><sub>1</sub></span>. The next version stores those values in temporary variables and prints them.</p>
<pre><code>def distance(x1, y1, x2, y2):
    dx = x2 - x1
    dy = y2 - y1
    print(&#39;dx is&#39;, dx)
    print(&#39;dy is&#39;, dy)
    return 0.0</code></pre>
<p>If the function is working, it should display <code>dx is 3</code> and <code>dy is 4</code>. If so, we know that the function is getting the right arguments and performing the first computation correctly. If not, there are only a few lines to check.</p>
<p>Next we compute the sum of squares of <span><code>dx</code></span> and <span><code>dy</code></span>:</p>
<pre><code>def distance(x1, y1, x2, y2):
    dx = x2 - x1
    dy = y2 - y1
    dsquared = dx**2 + dy**2
    print(&#39;dsquared is: &#39;, dsquared)
    return 0.0</code></pre>
<p>Again, you would run the program at this stage and check the output (which should be 25). Finally, you can use <span><code>math.sqrt</code></span> to compute and return the result:</p>
<pre><code>def distance(x1, y1, x2, y2):
    dx = x2 - x1
    dy = y2 - y1
    dsquared = dx**2 + dy**2
    result = math.sqrt(dsquared)
    return result</code></pre>
<p>If that works correctly, you are done. Otherwise, you might want to print the value of <span><code>result</code></span> before the return statement.</p>
<p>The final version of the function doesn’t display anything when it runs; it only returns a value. The <span><code>print</code></span> statements we wrote are useful for debugging, but once you get the function working, you should remove them. Code like that is called <span><strong>scaffolding</strong></span> because it is helpful for building the program but is not part of the final product.</p>
<p>When you start out, you should add only a line or two of code at a time. As you gain more experience, you might find yourself writing and debugging bigger chunks. Either way, incremental development can save you a lot of debugging time.</p>
<p>The key aspects of the process are:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Start with a working program and make small incremental changes. At any point, if there is an error, you should have a good idea where it is.</p></li>
<li><p>Use variables to hold intermediate values so you can display and check them.</p></li>
<li><p>Once the program is working, you might want to remove some of the scaffolding or consolidate multiple statements into compound expressions, but only if it does not make the program difficult to read.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>As an exercise, use incremental development to write a function called <span><code>hypotenuse</code></span> that returns the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle given the lengths of the other two legs as arguments. Record each stage of the development process as you go.</p>

<p>As you should expect by now, you can call one function from within another. As an example, we’ll write a function that takes two points, the center of the circle and a point on the perimeter, and computes the area of the circle.</p>
<p>Assume that the center point is stored in the variables <span><code>xc</code></span> and <span><code>yc</code></span>, and the perimeter point is in <span><code>xp</code></span> and <span><code>yp</code></span>. The first step is to find the radius of the circle, which is the distance between the two points. We just wrote a function, <span><code> distance</code></span>, that does that:</p>
<pre><code>radius = distance(xc, yc, xp, yp)</code></pre>
<p>The next step is to find the area of a circle with that radius; we just wrote that, too:</p>
<pre><code>result = area(radius)</code></pre>
<p>Encapsulating these steps in a function, we get:</p>
<pre><code>def circle_area(xc, yc, xp, yp):
    radius = distance(xc, yc, xp, yp)
    result = area(radius)
    return result</code></pre>
<p>The temporary variables <span><code>radius</code></span> and <span><code>result</code></span> are useful for development and debugging, but once the program is working, we can make it more concise by composing the function calls:</p>
<pre><code>def circle_area(xc, yc, xp, yp):
    return area(distance(xc, yc, xp, yp))</code></pre>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>Boolean functions</span> <span id="boolean" label="boolean">[boolean]</span></p>
<p>Functions can return booleans, which is often convenient for hiding complicated tests inside functions. For example:</p>
<pre><code>def is_divisible(x, y):
    if x % y == 0:
        return True
    else:
        return False</code></pre>
<p>It is common to give boolean functions names that sound like yes/no questions; <code>is_divisible</code> returns either <span><code>True</code></span> or <span><code>False</code></span> to indicate whether <span><code>x</code></span> is divisible by <span><code>y</code></span>.</p>
<p>Here is an example:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; is_divisible(6, 4)
False
&gt;&gt;&gt; is_divisible(6, 3)
True</code></pre>
<p>The result of the <span><code>==</code></span> operator is a boolean, so we can write the function more concisely by returning it directly:</p>
<pre><code>def is_divisible(x, y):
    return x % y == 0</code></pre>
<p>Boolean functions are often used in conditional statements:</p>
<pre><code>if is_divisible(x, y):
    print(&#39;x is divisible by y&#39;)</code></pre>
<p>It might be tempting to write something like:</p>
<pre><code>if is_divisible(x, y) == True:
    print(&#39;x is divisible by y&#39;)</code></pre>
<p>But the extra comparison is unnecessary.</p>
<p>As an exercise, write a function <code>is_between(x, y, z)</code> that returns <span><code>True</code></span> if <span class="math inline"><em>x</em> ≤ <em>y</em> ≤ <em>z</em></span> or <span><code>False</code></span> otherwise.</p>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>More recursion</span> <span id="more.recursion" label="more.recursion">[more.recursion]</span></p>
<p>We have only covered a small subset of Python, but you might be interested to know that this subset is a <span><em>complete</em></span> programming language, which means that anything that can be computed can be expressed in this language. Any program ever written could be rewritten using only the language features you have learned so far (actually, you would need a few commands to control devices like the mouse, disks, etc., but that’s all).</p>
<p>Proving that claim is a nontrivial exercise first accomplished by Alan Turing, one of the first computer scientists (some would argue that he was a mathematician, but a lot of early computer scientists started as mathematicians). Accordingly, it is known as the Turing Thesis. For a more complete (and accurate) discussion of the Turing Thesis, I recommend Michael Sipser’s book <span><em>Introduction to the Theory of Computation</em></span>.</p>
<p>To give you an idea of what you can do with the tools you have learned so far, we’ll evaluate a few recursively defined mathematical functions. A recursive definition is similar to a circular definition, in the sense that the definition contains a reference to the thing being defined. A truly circular definition is not very useful:</p>
<dl>
<dt>vorpal:</dt>
<dd><p>An adjective used to describe something that is vorpal.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>If you saw that definition in the dictionary, you might be annoyed. On the other hand, if you looked up the definition of the factorial function, denoted with the symbol <span class="math inline">!</span>, you might get something like this: <br /><span class="math display">$$\begin{aligned}
&amp;&amp;  0! = 1 \\
&amp;&amp;  n! = n (n-1)!\end{aligned}$$</span><br /> This definition says that the factorial of 0 is 1, and the factorial of any other value, <span class="math inline"><em>n</em></span>, is <span class="math inline"><em>n</em></span> multiplied by the factorial of <span class="math inline"><em>n</em> − 1</span>.</p>
<p>So <span class="math inline">3!</span> is 3 times <span class="math inline">2!</span>, which is 2 times <span class="math inline">1!</span>, which is 1 times <span class="math inline">0!</span>. Putting it all together, <span class="math inline">3!</span> equals 3 times 2 times 1 times 1, which is 6.</p>
<p>If you can write a recursive definition of something, you can write a Python program to evaluate it. The first step is to decide what the parameters should be. In this case it should be clear that <span><code>factorial</code></span> takes an integer:</p>
<pre><code>def factorial(n):</code></pre>
<p>If the argument happens to be 0, all we have to do is return 1:</p>
<pre><code>def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1</code></pre>
<p>Otherwise, and this is the interesting part, we have to make a recursive call to find the factorial of <span class="math inline"><em>n</em> − 1</span> and then multiply it by <span class="math inline"><em>n</em></span>:</p>
<pre><code>def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        recurse = factorial(n-1)
        result = n * recurse
        return result</code></pre>
<p>The flow of execution for this program is similar to the flow of <span><code> countdown</code></span> in Section <a href="#recursion" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="recursion">[recursion]</a>. If we call <span><code>factorial</code></span> with the value 3:</p>
<p>Since 3 is not 0, we take the second branch and calculate the factorial of <span><code>n-1</code></span>...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since 2 is not 0, we take the second branch and calculate the factorial of <span><code>n-1</code></span>...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since 1 is not 0, we take the second branch and calculate the factorial of <span><code>n-1</code></span>...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since 0 equals 0, we take the first branch and return 1 without making any more recursive calls.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The return value, 1, is multiplied by <span class="math inline"><em>n</em></span>, which is 1, and the result is returned.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The return value, 1, is multiplied by <span class="math inline"><em>n</em></span>, which is 2, and the result is returned.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The return value (2) is multiplied by <span class="math inline"><em>n</em></span>, which is 3, and the result, 6, becomes the return value of the function call that started the whole process.</p>
<p>Figure <a href="#fig.stack3" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig.stack3">7.1</a> shows what the stack diagram looks like for this sequence of function calls.</p>

<p>The return values are shown being passed back up the stack. In each frame, the return value is the value of <span><code>result</code></span>, which is the product of <span><code>n</code></span> and <span><code>recurse</code></span>.</p>
<p>In the last frame, the local variables <span><code>recurse</code></span> and <span><code>result</code></span> do not exist, because the branch that creates them does not run.</p>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>Leap of faith</span></p>
<p>Following the flow of execution is one way to read programs, but it can quickly become overwhelming. An alternative is what I call the “leap of faith”. When you come to a function call, instead of following the flow of execution, you <span> <em>assume</em></span> that the function works correctly and returns the right result.</p>
<p>In fact, you are already practicing this leap of faith when you use built-in functions. When you call <span><code>math.cos</code></span> or <span><code>math.exp</code></span>, you don’t examine the bodies of those functions. You just assume that they work because the people who wrote the built-in functions were good programmers.</p>
<p>The same is true when you call one of your own functions. For example, in Section <a href="#boolean" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="boolean">[boolean]</a>, we wrote a function called <code>is_divisible</code> that determines whether one number is divisible by another. Once we have convinced ourselves that this function is correct—by examining the code and testing—we can use the function without looking at the body again.</p>
<p>The same is true of recursive programs. When you get to the recursive call, instead of following the flow of execution, you should assume that the recursive call works (returns the correct result) and then ask yourself, “Assuming that I can find the factorial of <span class="math inline"><em>n</em> − 1</span>, can I compute the factorial of <span class="math inline"><em>n</em></span>?” It is clear that you can, by multiplying by <span class="math inline"><em>n</em></span>.</p>
<p>Of course, it’s a bit strange to assume that the function works correctly when you haven’t finished writing it, but that’s why it’s called a leap of faith!</p>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>One more example</span> <span id="one.more.example" label="one.more.example">[one.more.example]</span></p>
<p>After <span><code>factorial</code></span>, the most common example of a recursively defined mathematical function is <span><code>fibonacci</code></span>, which has the following definition (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number</a>): <br /><span class="math display">$$\begin{aligned}
&amp;&amp; \mathrm{fibonacci}(0) = 0 \\
&amp;&amp; \mathrm{fibonacci}(1) = 1 \\
&amp;&amp; \mathrm{fibonacci}(n) = \mathrm{fibonacci}(n-1) + \mathrm{fibonacci}(n-2)\end{aligned}$$</span><br /> Translated into Python, it looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>def fibonacci(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    elif  n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)</code></pre>
<p>If you try to follow the flow of execution here, even for fairly small values of <span class="math inline"><em>n</em></span>, your head explodes. But according to the leap of faith, if you assume that the two recursive calls work correctly, then it is clear that you get the right result by adding them together.</p>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>Checking types</span> <span id="guardian" label="guardian">[guardian]</span></p>
<p>What happens if we call <span><code>factorial</code></span> and give it 1.5 as an argument?</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; factorial(1.5)
RuntimeError: Maximum recursion depth exceeded</code></pre>
<p>It looks like an infinite recursion. How can that be? The function has a base case—when <span><code>n == 0</code></span>. But if <span><code>n</code></span> is not an integer, we can <span><em>miss</em></span> the base case and recurse forever.</p>
<p>In the first recursive call, the value of <span><code>n</code></span> is 0.5. In the next, it is -0.5. From there, it gets smaller (more negative), but it will never be 0.</p>
<p>We have two choices. We can try to generalize the <span><code>factorial</code></span> function to work with floating-point numbers, or we can make <span><code> factorial</code></span> check the type of its argument. The first option is called the gamma function and it’s a little beyond the scope of this book. So we’ll go for the second.</p>
<p>We can use the built-in function <span><code>isinstance</code></span> to verify the type of the argument. While we’re at it, we can also make sure the argument is positive:</p>
<pre><code>def factorial(n):
    if not isinstance(n, int):
        print(&#39;Factorial is only defined for integers.&#39;)
        return None
    elif n &lt; 0:
        print(&#39;Factorial is not defined for negative integers.&#39;)
        return None
    elif n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)</code></pre>
<p>The first base case handles nonintegers; the second handles negative integers. In both cases, the program prints an error message and returns <span><code>None</code></span> to indicate that something went wrong:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; print(factorial(&#39;fred&#39;))
Factorial is only defined for integers.
None
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(factorial(-2))
Factorial is not defined for negative integers.
None</code></pre>
<p>If we get past both checks, we know that <span class="math inline"><em>n</em></span> is a non-negative integer, so we can prove that the recursion terminates.</p>
<p>This program demonstrates a pattern sometimes called a <span><strong>guardian</strong></span>. The first two conditionals act as guardians, protecting the code that follows from values that might cause an error. The guardians make it possible to prove the correctness of the code.</p>
<p>In Section <a href="#raise" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="raise">[raise]</a> we will see a more flexible alternative to printing an error message: raising an exception.</p>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>Debugging</span> <span id="factdebug" label="factdebug">[factdebug]</span></p>
<p>Breaking a large program into smaller functions creates natural checkpoints for debugging. If a function is not working, there are three possibilities to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>There is something wrong with the arguments the function is getting; a precondition is violated.</p></li>
<li><p>There is something wrong with the function; a postcondition is violated.</p></li>
<li><p>There is something wrong with the return value or the way it is being used.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>To rule out the first possibility, you can add a <span><code>print</code></span> statement at the beginning of the function and display the values of the parameters (and maybe their types). Or you can write code that checks the preconditions explicitly.</p>
<p>If the parameters look good, add a <span><code>print</code></span> statement before each <span><code>return</code></span> statement and display the return value. If possible, check the result by hand. Consider calling the function with values that make it easy to check the result (as in Section <a href="#incremental.development" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="incremental.development">[incremental.development]</a>).</p>
<p>If the function seems to be working, look at the function call to make sure the return value is being used correctly (or used at all!).</p>
<p>Adding print statements at the beginning and end of a function can help make the flow of execution more visible. For example, here is a version of <span><code>factorial</code></span> with print statements:</p>
<pre><code>def factorial(n):
    space = &#39; &#39; * (4 * n)
    print(space, &#39;factorial&#39;, n)
    if n == 0:
        print(space, &#39;returning 1&#39;)
        return 1
    else:
        recurse = factorial(n-1)
        result = n * recurse
        print(space, &#39;returning&#39;, result)
        return result</code></pre>
<p><span><code>space</code></span> is a string of space characters that controls the indentation of the output. Here is the result of <span><code>factorial(4)</code></span> :</p>
<pre><code>                 factorial 4
             factorial 3
         factorial 2
     factorial 1
 factorial 0
 returning 1
     returning 1
         returning 2
             returning 6
                 returning 24</code></pre>
<p>If you are confused about the flow of execution, this kind of output can be helpful. It takes some time to develop effective scaffolding, but a little bit of scaffolding can save a lot of debugging.</p>

<p>A palindrome is a word that is spelled the same backward and forward, like “noon” and “redivider”. Recursively, a word is a palindrome if the first and last letters are the same and the middle is a palindrome.</p>
<p>The following are functions that take a string argument and return the first, last, and middle letters:</p>

<p>A number, <span class="math inline"><em>a</em></span>, is a power of <span class="math inline"><em>b</em></span> if it is divisible by <span class="math inline"><em>b</em></span> and <span class="math inline"><em>a</em>/<em>b</em></span> is a power of <span class="math inline"><em>b</em></span>.

<h1 id="iteration">Iteration</h1>
<p>This chapter is about iteration, which is the ability to run a block of statements repeatedly. We saw a kind of iteration, using recursion, in Section <a href="#recursion" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="recursion">[recursion]</a>. We saw another kind, using a <span><code>for</code></span> loop, in Section <a href="#repetition" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="repetition">[repetition]</a>. In this chapter we’ll see yet another kind, using a <span><code>while</code></span> statement. But first I want to say a little more about variable assignment.</p>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>Reassignment</span></p>
<p>As you may have discovered, it is legal to make more than one assignment to the same variable. A new assignment makes an existing variable refer to a new value (and stop referring to the old value).</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; x = 5
&gt;&gt;&gt; x
5
&gt;&gt;&gt; x = 7
&gt;&gt;&gt; x
7</code></pre>
<p>The first time we display <span><code>x</code></span>, its value is 5; the second time, its value is 7.</p>
<p>Figure <a href="#fig.assign2" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig.assign2">8.1</a> shows what <span><strong>reassignment</strong></span> looks like in a state diagram.</p>
<p>At this point I want to address a common source of confusion. Because Python uses the equal sign (<span><code>=</code></span>) for assignment, it is tempting to interpret a statement like <span><code>a = b</code></span> as a mathematical proposition of equality; that is, the claim that <span><code>a</code></span> and <span><code>b</code></span> are equal. But this interpretation is wrong.</p>
<p>First, equality is a symmetric relationship and assignment is not. For example, in mathematics, if <span class="math inline"><em>a</em> = 7</span> then <span class="math inline">7 = <em>a</em></span>. But in Python, the statement <span><code>a = 7</code></span> is legal and <span><code>7 = a</code></span> is not.</p>
<p>Also, in mathematics, a proposition of equality is either true or false for all time. If <span class="math inline"><em>a</em> = <em>b</em></span> now, then <span class="math inline"><em>a</em></span> will always equal <span class="math inline"><em>b</em></span>. In Python, an assignment statement can make two variables equal, but they don’t have to stay that way:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a = 5
&gt;&gt;&gt; b = a    # a and b are now equal
&gt;&gt;&gt; a = 3    # a and b are no longer equal
&gt;&gt;&gt; b
5</code></pre>
<p>The third line changes the value of <span><code>a</code></span> but does not change the value of <span><code>b</code></span>, so they are no longer equal.</p>
<p>Reassigning variables is often useful, but you should use it with caution. If the values of variables change frequently, it can make the code difficult to read and debug.</p>

<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>Updating variables</span> <span id="update" label="update">[update]</span></p>
<p>A common kind of reassignment is an <span><strong>update</strong></span>, where the new value of the variable depends on the old.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; x = x + 1</code></pre>
<p>This means “get the current value of <span><code>x</code></span>, add one, and then update <span><code>x</code></span> with the new value.”</p>
<p>If you try to update a variable that doesn’t exist, you get an error, because Python evaluates the right side before it assigns a value to <span><code>x</code></span>:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; x = x + 1
NameError: name &#39;x&#39; is not defined</code></pre>
<p>Before you can update a variable, you have to <span><strong>initialize</strong></span> it, usually with a simple assignment:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; x = 0
&gt;&gt;&gt; x = x + 1</code></pre>
<p>Updating a variable by adding 1 is called an <span><strong>increment</strong></span>; subtracting 1 is called a <span><strong>decrement</strong></span>.</p>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>The <span><code>while</code></span> statement</span></p>
<p>Computers are often used to automate repetitive tasks. Repeating identical or similar tasks without making errors is something that computers do well and people do poorly. In a computer program, repetition is also called <span><strong>iteration</strong></span>.</p>
<p>We have already seen two functions, <span><code>countdown</code></span> and <code>print_n</code>, that iterate using recursion. Because iteration is so common, Python provides language features to make it easier. One is the <span><code>for</code></span> statement we saw in Section <a href="#repetition" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="repetition">[repetition]</a>. We’ll get back to that later.</p>
<p>Another is the <span><code>while</code></span> statement. Here is a version of <span><code> countdown</code></span> that uses a <span><code>while</code></span> statement:</p>
<pre><code>def countdown(n):
    while n &gt; 0:
        print(n)
        n = n - 1
    print(&#39;Blastoff!&#39;)</code></pre>
<p>You can almost read the <span><code>while</code></span> statement as if it were English. It means, “While <span><code>n</code></span> is greater than 0, display the value of <span><code>n</code></span> and then decrement <span><code>n</code></span>. When you get to 0, display the word <span><code>Blastoff!</code></span>”</p>
<p>More formally, here is the flow of execution for a <span><code>while</code></span> statement:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Determine whether the condition is true or false.</p></li>
<li><p>If false, exit the <span><code>while</code></span> statement and continue execution at the next statement.</p></li>
<li><p>If the condition is true, run the body and then go back to step 1.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>This type of flow is called a loop because the third step loops back around to the top.</p>
<p>The body of the loop should change the value of one or more variables so that the condition becomes false eventually and the loop terminates. Otherwise the loop will repeat forever, which is called an <span><strong>infinite loop</strong></span>. An endless source of amusement for computer scientists is the observation that the directions on shampoo, “Lather, rinse, repeat”, are an infinite loop.</p>
<p>In the case of <span><code>countdown</code></span>, we can prove that the loop terminates: if <span><code>n</code></span> is zero or negative, the loop never runs. Otherwise, <span><code>n</code></span> gets smaller each time through the loop, so eventually we have to get to 0.</p>
<p>For some other loops, it is not so easy to tell. For example:</p>
<pre><code>def sequence(n):
    while n != 1:
        print(n)
        if n % 2 == 0:        # n is even
            n = n / 2
        else:                 # n is odd
            n = n*3 + 1</code></pre>
<p>The condition for this loop is <span><code>n != 1</code></span>, so the loop will continue until <span><code>n</code></span> is <span><code>1</code></span>, which makes the condition false.</p>
<p>Each time through the loop, the program outputs the value of <span><code>n</code></span> and then checks whether it is even or odd. If it is even, <span><code>n</code></span> is divided by 2. If it is odd, the value of <span><code>n</code></span> is replaced with <span><code>n*3 + 1</code></span>. For example, if the argument passed to <span><code>sequence</code></span> is 3, the resulting values of <span><code>n</code></span> are 3, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1.</p>
<p>Since <span><code>n</code></span> sometimes increases and sometimes decreases, there is no obvious proof that <span><code>n</code></span> will ever reach 1, or that the program terminates. For some particular values of <span><code>n</code></span>, we can prove termination. For example, if the starting value is a power of two, <span><code>n</code></span> will be even every time through the loop until it reaches 1. The previous example ends with such a sequence, starting with 16.</p>
<p>The hard question is whether we can prove that this program terminates for <span><em>all</em></span> positive values of <span><code>n</code></span>. So far, no one has been able to prove it <span><em>or</em></span> disprove it! (See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture</a>.)</p>
<p>As an exercise, rewrite the function <code>print_n</code> from Section <a href="#recursion" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="recursion">[recursion]</a> using iteration instead of recursion.</p>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span><code>break</code></span></p>
<p>Sometimes you don’t know it’s time to end a loop until you get half way through the body. In that case you can use the <span><code>break</code></span> statement to jump out of the loop.</p>
<p>For example, suppose you want to take input from the user until they type <span><code>done</code></span>. You could write:</p>
<pre><code>while True:
    line = input(&#39;&gt; &#39;)
    if line == &#39;done&#39;:
        break
    print(line)

print(&#39;Done!&#39;)</code></pre>
<p>The loop condition is <span><code>True</code></span>, which is always true, so the loop runs until it hits the break statement.</p>
<p>Each time through, it prompts the user with an angle bracket. If the user types <span><code>done</code></span>, the <span><code>break</code></span> statement exits the loop. Otherwise the program echoes whatever the user types and goes back to the top of the loop. Here’s a sample run:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; not done
not done
&gt; done
Done!</code></pre>
<p>This way of writing <span><code>while</code></span> loops is common because you can check the condition anywhere in the loop (not just at the top) and you can express the stop condition affirmatively (“stop when this happens”) rather than negatively (“keep going until that happens”).</p>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>Square roots</span> <span id="squareroot" label="squareroot">[squareroot]</span></p>
<p>Loops are often used in programs that compute numerical results by starting with an approximate answer and iteratively improving it.</p>
<p>For example, one way of computing square roots is Newton’s method. Suppose that you want to know the square root of <span class="math inline"><em>a</em></span>. If you start with almost any estimate, <span class="math inline"><em>x</em></span>, you can compute a better estimate with the following formula:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math display">$$y = \frac{x + a/x}{2}$$</span><br /> For example, if <span class="math inline"><em>a</em></span> is 4 and <span class="math inline"><em>x</em></span> is 3:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a = 4
&gt;&gt;&gt; x = 3
&gt;&gt;&gt; y = (x + a/x) / 2
&gt;&gt;&gt; y
2.16666666667</code></pre>
<p>The result is closer to the correct answer (<span class="math inline">$\sqrt{4} = 2$</span>). If we repeat the process with the new estimate, it gets even closer:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; x = y
&gt;&gt;&gt; y = (x + a/x) / 2
&gt;&gt;&gt; y
2.00641025641</code></pre>
<p>After a few more updates, the estimate is almost exact:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; x = y
&gt;&gt;&gt; y = (x + a/x) / 2
&gt;&gt;&gt; y
2.00001024003
&gt;&gt;&gt; x = y
&gt;&gt;&gt; y = (x + a/x) / 2
&gt;&gt;&gt; y
2.00000000003</code></pre>
<p>In general we don’t know ahead of time how many steps it takes to get to the right answer, but we know when we get there because the estimate stops changing:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; x = y
&gt;&gt;&gt; y = (x + a/x) / 2
&gt;&gt;&gt; y
2.0
&gt;&gt;&gt; x = y
&gt;&gt;&gt; y = (x + a/x) / 2
&gt;&gt;&gt; y
2.0</code></pre>
<p>When <span><code>y == x</code></span>, we can stop. Here is a loop that starts with an initial estimate, <span><code>x</code></span>, and improves it until it stops changing:</p>
<pre><code>while True:
    print(x)
    y = (x + a/x) / 2
    if y == x:
        break
    x = y</code></pre>
<p>For most values of <span><code>a</code></span> this works fine, but in general it is dangerous to test <span><code>float</code></span> equality. Floating-point values are only approximately right: most rational numbers, like <span class="math inline">1/3</span>, and irrational numbers, like <span class="math inline">$\sqrt{2}$</span>, can’t be represented exactly with a <span><code>float</code></span>.</p>
<p>Rather than checking whether <span><code>x</code></span> and <span><code>y</code></span> are exactly equal, it is safer to use the built-in function <span><code>abs</code></span> to compute the absolute value, or magnitude, of the difference between them:</p>
<pre><code>    if abs(y-x) &lt; epsilon:
        break</code></pre>
<p>Where <code>epsilon</code> has a value like <span><code>0.0000001</code></span> that determines how close is close enough.</p>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>Algorithms</span></p>
<p>Newton’s method is an example of an <span><strong>algorithm</strong></span>: it is a mechanical process for solving a category of problems (in this case, computing square roots).</p>
<p>To understand what an algorithm is, it might help to start with something that is not an algorithm. When you learned to multiply single-digit numbers, you probably memorized the multiplication table. In effect, you memorized 100 specific solutions. That kind of knowledge is not algorithmic.</p>
<p>But if you were “lazy”, you might have learned a few tricks. For example, to find the product of <span class="math inline"><em>n</em></span> and 9, you can write <span class="math inline"><em>n</em> − 1</span> as the first digit and <span class="math inline">10 − <em>n</em></span> as the second digit. This trick is a general solution for multiplying any single-digit number by 9. That’s an algorithm!</p>
<p>Similarly, the techniques you learned for addition with carrying, subtraction with borrowing, and long division are all algorithms. One of the characteristics of algorithms is that they do not require any intelligence to carry out. They are mechanical processes where each step follows from the last according to a simple set of rules.</p>
<p>Executing algorithms is boring, but designing them is interesting, intellectually challenging, and a central part of computer science.</p>
<p>Some of the things that people do naturally, without difficulty or conscious thought, are the hardest to express algorithmically. Understanding natural language is a good example. We all do it, but so far no one has been able to explain <span><em>how</em></span> we do it, at least not in the form of an algorithm.</p>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>Debugging</span> <span id="bisectbug" label="bisectbug">[bisectbug]</span></p>
<p>As you start writing bigger programs, you might find yourself spending more time debugging. More code means more chances to make an error and more places for bugs to hide.</p>
<p>One way to cut your debugging time is “debugging by bisection”. For example, if there are 100 lines in your program and you check them one at a time, it would take 100 steps.</p>
<p>Instead, try to break the problem in half. Look at the middle of the program, or near it, for an intermediate value you can check. Add a <span><code>print</code></span> statement (or something else that has a verifiable effect) and run the program.</p>
<p>If the mid-point check is incorrect, there must be a problem in the first half of the program. If it is correct, the problem is in the second half.</p>
<p>Every time you perform a check like this, you halve the number of lines you have to search. After six steps (which is fewer than 100), you would be down to one or two lines of code, at least in theory.</p>
<p>In practice it is not always clear what the “middle of the program” is and not always possible to check it. It doesn’t make sense to count lines and find the exact midpoint. Instead, think about places in the program where there might be errors and places where it is easy to put a check. Then choose a spot where you think the chances are about the same that the bug is before or after the check.</p>

<p>Copy the loop from Section <a href="#squareroot" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="squareroot">[squareroot]</a> and encapsulate it in a function called <code>mysqrt</code> that takes <span><code>a</code></span> as a parameter, chooses a reasonable value of <span><code>x</code></span>, and returns an estimate of the square root of <span><code>a</code></span>.</p>
<p>To test it, write a function named <code>test_square_root</code> that prints a table like this:</p>

<p>The built-in function <span><code>eval</code></span> takes a string and evaluates it using the Python interpreter. For example:</p>

<p>Write a function called <code>eval_loop</code> that iteratively prompts the user, takes the resulting input and evaluates it using <span><code>eval</code></span>, and prints the result.</p>
<p>It should continue until the user enters <code>'done'</code>, and then return the value of the last expression it evaluated.</p>

<h1 id="strings">Strings</h1>
<p>Strings are not like integers, floats, and booleans. A string is a <span><strong>sequence</strong></span>, which means it is an ordered collection of other values. In this chapter you’ll see how to access the characters that make up a string, and you’ll learn about some of the methods strings provide.</p>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>A string is a sequence</span></p>
<p>A string is a sequence of characters. You can access the characters one at a time with the bracket operator:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; fruit = &#39;banana&#39;
&gt;&gt;&gt; letter = fruit[1]</code></pre>
<p>The second statement selects character number 1 from <span><code> fruit</code></span> and assigns it to <span><code>letter</code></span>.</p>
<p>The expression in brackets is called an <span><strong>index</strong></span>. The index indicates which character in the sequence you want (hence the name).</p>
<p>But you might not get what you expect:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; letter
&#39;a&#39;</code></pre>
<p>For most people, the first letter of <code>'banana'</code> is <span><code>b</code></span>, not <span><code>a</code></span>. But for computer scientists, the index is an offset from the beginning of the string, and the offset of the first letter is zero.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; letter = fruit[0]
&gt;&gt;&gt; letter
&#39;b&#39;</code></pre>
<p>So <span><code>b</code></span> is the 0th letter (“zero-eth”) of <code>'banana'</code>, <span><code> a</code></span> is the 1th letter (“one-eth”), and <span><code>n</code></span> is the 2th letter (“two-eth”).</p>
<p>As an index you can use an expression that contains variables and operators:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; i = 1
&gt;&gt;&gt; fruit[i]
&#39;a&#39;
&gt;&gt;&gt; fruit[i+1]
&#39;n&#39;</code></pre>
<p>But the value of the index has to be an integer. Otherwise you get:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; letter = fruit[1.5]
TypeError: string indices must be integers</code></pre>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span><code>len</code></span></p>
<p><span><code>len</code></span> is a built-in function that returns the number of characters in a string:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; fruit = &#39;banana&#39;
&gt;&gt;&gt; len(fruit)
6</code></pre>
<p>To get the last letter of a string, you might be tempted to try something like this:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; length = len(fruit)
&gt;&gt;&gt; last = fruit[length]
IndexError: string index out of range</code></pre>
<p>The reason for the <span><code>IndexError</code></span> is that there is no letter in <span><code> ’banana’</code></span> with the index 6. Since we started counting at zero, the six letters are numbered 0 to 5. To get the last character, you have to subtract 1 from <span><code>length</code></span>:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; last = fruit[length-1]
&gt;&gt;&gt; last
&#39;a&#39;</code></pre>
<p>Or you can use negative indices, which count backward from the end of the string. The expression <span><code>fruit[-1]</code></span> yields the last letter, <span><code>fruit[-2]</code></span> yields the second to last, and so on.</p>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>Traversal with a <span><code>for</code></span> loop</span> <span id="for" label="for">[for]</span></p>
<p>A lot of computations involve processing a string one character at a time. Often they start at the beginning, select each character in turn, do something to it, and continue until the end. This pattern of processing is called a <span><strong>traversal</strong></span>. One way to write a traversal is with a <span><code>while</code></span> loop:</p>
<pre><code>index = 0
while index &lt; len(fruit):
    letter = fruit[index]
    print(letter)
    index = index + 1</code></pre>
<p>This loop traverses the string and displays each letter on a line by itself. The loop condition is <span><code>index &lt; len(fruit)</code></span>, so when <span><code>index</code></span> is equal to the length of the string, the condition is false, and the body of the loop doesn’t run. The last character accessed is the one with the index <span><code>len(fruit)-1</code></span>, which is the last character in the string.</p>
<p>As an exercise, write a function that takes a string as an argument and displays the letters backward, one per line.</p>
<p>Another way to write a traversal is with a <span><code>for</code></span> loop:</p>
<pre><code>for letter in fruit:
    print(letter)</code></pre>
<p>Each time through the loop, the next character in the string is assigned to the variable <span><code>letter</code></span>. The loop continues until no characters are left.</p>
<p>The following example shows how to use concatenation (string addition) and a <span><code>for</code></span> loop to generate an abecedarian series (that is, in alphabetical order). In Robert McCloskey’s book <span><em>Make Way for Ducklings</em></span>, the names of the ducklings are Jack, Kack, Lack, Mack, Nack, Ouack, Pack, and Quack. This loop outputs these names in order:</p>
<pre><code>prefixes = &#39;JKLMNOPQ&#39;
suffix = &#39;ack&#39;

for letter in prefixes:
    print(letter + suffix)</code></pre>
<p>The output is:</p>
<pre><code>Jack
Kack
Lack
Mack
Nack
Oack
Pack
Qack</code></pre>
<p>Of course, that’s not quite right because “Ouack” and “Quack” are misspelled. As an exercise, modify the program to fix this error.</p>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>String slices</span> <span id="slice" label="slice">[slice]</span></p>
<p>A segment of a string is called a <span><strong>slice</strong></span>. Selecting a slice is similar to selecting a character:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; s = &#39;Monty Python&#39;
&gt;&gt;&gt; s[0:5]
&#39;Monty&#39;
&gt;&gt;&gt; s[6:12]
&#39;Python&#39;</code></pre>
<p>The operator <span><code>[n:m]</code></span> returns the part of the string from the “n-eth” character to the “m-eth” character, including the first but excluding the last. This behavior is counterintuitive, but it might help to imagine the indices pointing <span><em>between</em></span> the characters, as in Figure <a href="#fig.banana" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig.banana">9.1</a>.</p>
<figure>
<embed src="figs/banana.pdf" id="fig.banana" /><figcaption>Slice indices.<span label="fig.banana"></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>If you omit the first index (before the colon), the slice starts at the beginning of the string. If you omit the second index, the slice goes to the end of the string:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; fruit = &#39;banana&#39;
&gt;&gt;&gt; fruit[:3]
&#39;ban&#39;
&gt;&gt;&gt; fruit[3:]
&#39;ana&#39;</code></pre>
<p>If the first index is greater than or equal to the second the result is an <span><strong>empty string</strong></span>, represented by two quotation marks:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; fruit = &#39;banana&#39;
&gt;&gt;&gt; fruit[3:3]
&#39;&#39;</code></pre>
<p>An empty string contains no characters and has length 0, but other than that, it is the same as any other string.</p>
<p>Continuing this example, what do you think <span><code>fruit[:]</code></span> means? Try it and see.</p>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>Strings are immutable</span></p>
<p>It is tempting to use the <span><code>[]</code></span> operator on the left side of an assignment, with the intention of changing a character in a string. For example:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; greeting = &#39;Hello, world!&#39;
&gt;&gt;&gt; greeting[0] = &#39;J&#39;
TypeError: &#39;str&#39; object does not support item assignment</code></pre>
<p>The “object” in this case is the string and the “item” is the character you tried to assign. For now, an object is the same thing as a value, but we will refine that definition later (Section <a href="#equivalence" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="equivalence">[equivalence]</a>).</p>
<p>The reason for the error is that strings are <span><strong>immutable</strong></span>, which means you can’t change an existing string. The best you can do is create a new string that is a variation on the original:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; greeting = &#39;Hello, world!&#39;
&gt;&gt;&gt; new_greeting = &#39;J&#39; + greeting[1:]
&gt;&gt;&gt; new_greeting
&#39;Jello, world!&#39;</code></pre>
<p>This example concatenates a new first letter onto a slice of <span><code>greeting</code></span>. It has no effect on the original string.</p>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>Searching</span> <span id="find" label="find">[find]</span></p>
<p>What does the following function do?</p>
<pre><code>def find(word, letter):
    index = 0
    while index &lt; len(word):
        if word[index] == letter:
            return index
        index = index + 1
    return -1</code></pre>
<p>In a sense, <span><code>find</code></span> is the inverse of the <span><code>[]</code></span> operator. Instead of taking an index and extracting the corresponding character, it takes a character and finds the index where that character appears. If the character is not found, the function returns <span><code> -1</code></span>.</p>
<p>This is the first example we have seen of a <span><code>return</code></span> statement inside a loop. If <span><code>word[index] == letter</code></span>, the function breaks out of the loop and returns immediately.</p>
<p>If the character doesn’t appear in the string, the program exits the loop normally and returns <span><code>-1</code></span>.</p>
<p>This pattern of computation—traversing a sequence and returning when we find what we are looking for—is called a <span><strong>search</strong></span>.</p>
<p>As an exercise, modify <span><code>find</code></span> so that it has a third parameter, the index in <span><code>word</code></span> where it should start looking.</p>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>Looping and counting</span> <span id="counter" label="counter">[counter]</span></p>
<p>The following program counts the number of times the letter <span><code>a</code></span> appears in a string:</p>
<pre><code>word = &#39;banana&#39;
count = 0
for letter in word:
    if letter == &#39;a&#39;:
        count = count + 1
print(count)</code></pre>
<p>This program demonstrates another pattern of computation called a <span> <strong>counter</strong></span>. The variable <span><code>count</code></span> is initialized to 0 and then incremented each time an <span><code>a</code></span> is found. When the loop exits, <span><code>count</code></span> contains the result—the total number of <span><code>a</code></span>’s.</p>
<p>As an exercise, encapsulate this code in a function named <span><code> count</code></span>, and generalize it so that it accepts the string and the letter as arguments.</p>
<p>Then rewrite the function so that instead of traversing the string, it uses the three-parameter version of <span><code> find</code></span> from the previous section.</p>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>String methods</span> <span id="optional" label="optional">[optional]</span></p>
<p>Strings provide methods that perform a variety of useful operations. A method is similar to a function—it takes arguments and returns a value—but the syntax is different. For example, the method <span><code>upper</code></span> takes a string and returns a new string with all uppercase letters.</p>
<p>Instead of the function syntax <span><code>upper(word)</code></span>, it uses the method syntax <span><code>word.upper()</code></span>.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; word = &#39;banana&#39;
&gt;&gt;&gt; new_word = word.upper()
&gt;&gt;&gt; new_word
&#39;BANANA&#39;</code></pre>
<p>This form of dot notation specifies the name of the method, <span><code> upper</code></span>, and the name of the string to apply the method to, <span><code> word</code></span>. The empty parentheses indicate that this method takes no arguments.</p>
<p>A method call is called an <span><strong>invocation</strong></span>; in this case, we would say that we are invoking <span><code>upper</code></span> on <span><code>word</code></span>.</p>
<p>As it turns out, there is a string method named <span><code>find</code></span> that is remarkably similar to the function we wrote:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; word = &#39;banana&#39;
&gt;&gt;&gt; index = word.find(&#39;a&#39;)
&gt;&gt;&gt; index
1</code></pre>
<p>In this example, we invoke <span><code>find</code></span> on <span><code>word</code></span> and pass the letter we are looking for as a parameter.</p>
<p>Actually, the <span><code>find</code></span> method is more general than our function; it can find substrings, not just characters:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; word.find(&#39;na&#39;)
2</code></pre>
<p>By default, <span><code>find</code></span> starts at the beginning of the string, but it can take a second argument, the index where it should start:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; word.find(&#39;na&#39;, 3)
4</code></pre>
<p>This is an example of an <span><strong>optional argument</strong></span>; <span><code>find</code></span> can also take a third argument, the index where it should stop:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; name = &#39;bob&#39;
&gt;&gt;&gt; name.find(&#39;b&#39;, 1, 2)
-1</code></pre>
<p>This search fails because <span><code>b</code></span> does not appear in the index range from <span><code>1</code></span> to <span><code>2</code></span>, not including <span><code> 2</code></span>. Searching up to, but not including, the second index makes <span><code>find</code></span> consistent with the slice operator.</p>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>The <span><code>in</code></span> operator</span> <span id="inboth" label="inboth">[inboth]</span></p>
<p>The word <span><code>in</code></span> is a boolean operator that takes two strings and returns <span><code>True</code></span> if the first appears as a substring in the second:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; &#39;a&#39; in &#39;banana&#39;
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; &#39;seed&#39; in &#39;banana&#39;
False</code></pre>
<p>For example, the following function prints all the letters from <span><code>word1</code></span> that also appear in <span><code>word2</code></span>:</p>
<pre><code>def in_both(word1, word2):
    for letter in word1:
        if letter in word2:
            print(letter)</code></pre>
<p>With well-chosen variable names, Python sometimes reads like English. You could read this loop, “for (each) letter in (the first) word, if (the) letter (appears) in (the second) word, print (the) letter.”</p>
<p>Here’s what you get if you compare apples and oranges:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; in_both(&#39;apples&#39;, &#39;oranges&#39;)
a
e
s</code></pre>

<p>The relational operators work on strings. To see if two strings are equal:</p>
<pre><code>if word == &#39;banana&#39;:
    print(&#39;All right, bananas.&#39;)</code></pre>
<p>Other relational operations are useful for putting words in alphabetical order:</p>
<pre><code>if word &lt; &#39;banana&#39;:
    print(&#39;Your word, &#39; + word + &#39;, comes before banana.&#39;)
elif word &gt; &#39;banana&#39;:
    print(&#39;Your word, &#39; + word + &#39;, comes after banana.&#39;)
else:
    print(&#39;All right, bananas.&#39;)</code></pre>
<p>Python does not handle uppercase and lowercase letters the same way people do. All the uppercase letters come before all the lowercase letters, so:</p>
<pre><code>Your word, Pineapple, comes before banana.</code></pre>
<p>A common way to address this problem is to convert strings to a standard format, such as all lowercase, before performing the comparison. Keep that in mind in case you have to defend yourself against a man armed with a Pineapple.</p>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>Debugging</span></p>
<p>When you use indices to traverse the values in a sequence, it is tricky to get the beginning and end of the traversal right. Here is a function that is supposed to compare two words and return <span><code>True</code></span> if one of the words is the reverse of the other, but it contains two errors:</p>
<pre><code>def is_reverse(word1, word2):
    if len(word1) != len(word2):
        return False
    
    i = 0
    j = len(word2)

    while j &gt; 0:
        if word1[i] != word2[j]:
            return False
        i = i+1
        j = j-1

    return True</code></pre>
<p>The first <span><code>if</code></span> statement checks whether the words are the same length. If not, we can return <span><code>False</code></span> immediately. Otherwise, for the rest of the function, we can assume that the words are the same length. This is an example of the guardian pattern in Section <a href="#guardian" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="guardian">[guardian]</a>.</p>
<p><span><code>i</code></span> and <span><code>j</code></span> are indices: <span><code>i</code></span> traverses <span><code>word1</code></span> forward while <span><code>j</code></span> traverses <span><code>word2</code></span> backward. If we find two letters that don’t match, we can return <span><code>False</code></span> immediately. If we get through the whole loop and all the letters match, we return <span><code>True</code></span>.</p>
<p>If we test this function with the words “pots” and “stop”, we expect the return value <span><code>True</code></span>, but we get an IndexError:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; is_reverse(&#39;pots&#39;, &#39;stop&#39;)
...
  File &quot;reverse.py&quot;, line 15, in is_reverse
    if word1[i] != word2[j]:
IndexError: string index out of range</code></pre>
<p>For debugging this kind of error, my first move is to print the values of the indices immediately before the line where the error appears.</p>
<pre><code>    while j &gt; 0:
        print(i, j)        # print here
        
        if word1[i] != word2[j]:
            return False
        i = i+1
        j = j-1</code></pre>
<p>Now when I run the program again, I get more information:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; is_reverse(&#39;pots&#39;, &#39;stop&#39;)
0 4
...
IndexError: string index out of range</code></pre>
<p>The first time through the loop, the value of <span><code>j</code></span> is 4, which is out of range for the string <code>'pots'</code>. The index of the last character is 3, so the initial value for <span><code>j</code></span> should be <span><code>len(word2)-1</code></span>.</p>
<p>If I fix that error and run the program again, I get:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; is_reverse(&#39;pots&#39;, &#39;stop&#39;)
0 3
1 2
2 1
True</code></pre>
<p>This time we get the right answer, but it looks like the loop only ran three times, which is suspicious. To get a better idea of what is happening, it is useful to draw a state diagram. During the first iteration, the frame for <code>is_reverse</code> is shown in Figure <a href="#fig.state4" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig.state4">9.2</a>.</p>
<figure>
<embed src="figs/state4.pdf" id="fig.state4" /><figcaption>State diagram.<span label="fig.state4"></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I took some license by arranging the variables in the frame and adding dotted lines to show that the values of <span><code>i</code></span> and <span><code>j</code></span> indicate characters in <span><code>word1</code></span> and <span><code>word2</code></span>.</p>
<p>Starting with this diagram, run the program on paper, changing the values of <span><code>i</code></span> and <span><code>j</code></span> during each iteration. Find and fix the second error in this function. <span id="isreverse" label="isreverse">[isreverse]</span></p>

<p>Read the documentation of the string methods at <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods">http://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods</a>. You might want to experiment with some of them to make sure you understand how they work. <span><code>strip</code></span> and <span><code>replace</code></span> are particularly useful.</p>
<p>The documentation uses a syntax that might be confusing. For example, in <code>find(sub[, start[, end]])</code>, the brackets indicate optional arguments. So <span><code>sub</code></span> is required, but <span><code>start</code></span> is optional, and if you include <span><code>start</code></span>, then <span><code>end</code></span> is optional.</p>
<p>There is a string method called <span><code>count</code></span> that is similar to the function in Section <a href="#counter" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="counter">[counter]</a>. Read the documentation of this method and write an invocation that counts the number of <span><code>a</code></span>’s in <code>'banana'</code>.</p>
<p>A string slice can take a third index that specifies the “step size”; that is, the number of spaces between successive characters. A step size of 2 means every other character; 3 means every third, etc.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; fruit = &#39;banana&#39;
&gt;&gt;&gt; fruit[0:5:2]
&#39;bnn&#39;</code></pre>
<p>A step size of -1 goes through the word backwards, so the slice <code>[::-1]</code> generates a reversed string.</p>
<p>Use this idiom to write a one-line version of <code>is_palindrome</code> from Exercise <a href="#palindrome" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="palindrome">[palindrome]</a>.</p>
<p>The following functions are all <span><em>intended</em></span> to check whether a string contains any lowercase letters, but at least some of them are wrong. For each function, describe what the function actually does (assuming that the parameter is a string).</p>

<p><span id="exrotate" label="exrotate">[exrotate]</span> A Caesar cypher is a weak form of encryption that involves “rotating” each letter by a fixed number of places. To rotate a letter means to shift it through the alphabet, wrapping around to the beginning if necessary, so ’A’ rotated by 3 is ’D’ and ’Z’ rotated by 1 is ’A’.</p>
<p>To rotate a word, rotate each letter by the same amount. For example, “cheer” rotated by 7 is “jolly” and “melon” rotated by -10 is “cubed”. In the movie <span><em>2001: A Space Odyssey</em></span>, the ship computer is called HAL, which is IBM rotated by -1.</p>
<p>Write a function called <code>rotate_word</code> that takes a string and an integer as parameters, and returns a new string that contains the letters from the original string rotated by the given amount.</p>
<p>You might want to use the built-in function <span><code>ord</code></span>, which converts a character to a numeric code, and <span><code>chr</code></span>, which converts numeric codes to characters. Letters of the alphabet are encoded in alphabetical order, so for example:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; ord(&#39;c&#39;) - ord(&#39;a&#39;)
2</code></pre>
<p>Because <code>'c'</code> is the two-eth letter of the alphabet. But beware: the numeric codes for upper case letters are different.</p>
<p>Potentially offensive jokes on the Internet are sometimes encoded in ROT13, which is a Caesar cypher with rotation 13. If you are not easily offended, find and decode some of them. Solution: <a href="http://thinkpython2.com/code/rotate.py">http://thinkpython2.com/code/rotate.py</a>.</p>
<h1 id="wordplay">Case study: word play</h1>
<p>This chapter presents the second case study, which involves solving word puzzles by searching for words that have certain properties. For example, we’ll find the longest palindromes in English and search for words whose letters appear in alphabetical order. And I will present another program development plan: reduction to a previously solved problem.</p>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>Reading word lists</span> <span id="wordlist" label="wordlist">[wordlist]</span></p>
<p>For the exercises in this chapter we need a list of English words. There are lots of word lists available on the Web, but the one most suitable for our purpose is one of the word lists collected and contributed to the public domain by Grady Ward as part of the Moby lexicon project (see <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Moby_Project">http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Moby_Project</a>). It is a list of 113,809 official crosswords; that is, words that are considered valid in crossword puzzles and other word games. In the Moby collection, the filename is <span><code>113809of.fic</code></span>; you can download a copy, with the simpler name <span><code>words.txt</code></span>, from <a href="http://thinkpython2.com/code/words.txt">http://thinkpython2.com/code/words.txt</a>.</p>
<p>This file is in plain text, so you can open it with a text editor, but you can also read it from Python. The built-in function <span><code>open</code></span> takes the name of the file as a parameter and returns a <span><strong>file object</strong></span> you can use to read the file.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; fin = open(&#39;words.txt&#39;)</code></pre>
<p><span><code>fin</code></span> is a common name for a file object used for input. The file object provides several methods for reading, including <span><code>readline</code></span>, which reads characters from the file until it gets to a newline and returns the result as a string:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; fin.readline()
&#39;aa\n&#39;</code></pre>
<p>The first word in this particular list is “aa”, which is a kind of lava. The sequence <code>\n</code> represents the newline character that separates this word from the next.</p>
<p>The file object keeps track of where it is in the file, so if you call <span><code>readline</code></span> again, you get the next word:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; fin.readline()
&#39;aah\n&#39;</code></pre>
<p>The next word is “aah”, which is a perfectly legitimate word, so stop looking at me like that. Or, if it’s the newline character that’s bothering you, we can get rid of it with the string method <span><code>strip</code></span>:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; line = fin.readline()
&gt;&gt;&gt; word = line.strip()
&gt;&gt;&gt; word
&#39;aahed&#39;</code></pre>
<p>You can also use a file object as part of a <span><code>for</code></span> loop. This program reads <span><code>words.txt</code></span> and prints each word, one per line:</p>
<pre><code>fin = open(&#39;words.txt&#39;)
for line in fin:
    word = line.strip()
    print(word)</code></pre>

<p>There are solutions to these exercises in the next section. You should at least attempt each one before you read the solutions.</p>
<p>Write a program that reads <span><code>words.txt</code></span> and prints only the words with more than 20 characters (not counting whitespace).</p>
<p>In 1939 Ernest Vincent Wright published a 50,000 word novel called <span><em>Gadsby</em></span> that does not contain the letter “e”. Since “e” is the most common letter in English, that’s not easy to do.</p>
<p>In fact, it is difficult to construct a solitary thought without using that most common symbol. It is slow going at first, but with caution and hours of training you can gradually gain facility.</p>
<p>All right, I’ll stop now.</p>
<p>Write a function called <code>has_no_e</code> that returns <span><code>True</code></span> if the given word doesn’t have the letter “e” in it.</p>
<p>Write a program that reads <span><code>words.txt</code></span> and prints only the words that have no “e”. Compute the percentage of words in the list that have no “e”.</p>
<p>Write a function named <span><code>avoids</code></span> that takes a word and a string of forbidden letters, and that returns <span><code>True</code></span> if the word doesn’t use any of the forbidden letters.</p>
<p>Write a program that prompts the user to enter a string of forbidden letters and then prints the number of words that don’t contain any of them. Can you find a combination of 5 forbidden letters that excludes the smallest number of words?</p>
<p>Write a function named <code>uses_only</code> that takes a word and a string of letters, and that returns <span><code>True</code></span> if the word contains only letters in the list. Can you make a sentence using only the letters <span><code>acefhlo</code></span>? Other than “Hoe alfalfa”?</p>
<p>Write a function named <code>uses_all</code> that takes a word and a string of required letters, and that returns <span><code>True</code></span> if the word uses all the required letters at least once. How many words are there that use all the vowels <span><code>aeiou</code></span>? How about <span><code>aeiouy</code></span>?</p>
<p>Write a function called <code>is_abecedarian</code> that returns <span><code>True</code></span> if the letters in a word appear in alphabetical order (double letters are ok). How many abecedarian words are there?</p>

<p>All of the exercises in the previous section have something in common; they can be solved with the search pattern we saw in Section <a href="#find" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="find">[find]</a>. The simplest example is:</p>
<pre><code>def has_no_e(word):
    for letter in word:
        if letter == &#39;e&#39;:
            return False
    return True</code></pre>
<p>The <span><code>for</code></span> loop traverses the characters in <span><code>word</code></span>. If we find the letter “e”, we can immediately return <span><code>False</code></span>; otherwise we have to go to the next letter. If we exit the loop normally, that means we didn’t find an “e”, so we return <span><code>True</code></span>.</p>
<p>You could write this function more concisely using the <span><code>in</code></span> operator, but I started with this version because it demonstrates the logic of the search pattern.</p>
<p><span><code>avoids</code></span> is a more general version of <code>has_no_e</code> but it has the same structure:</p>
<pre><code>def avoids(word, forbidden):
    for letter in word:
        if letter in forbidden:
            return False
    return True</code></pre>
<p>We can return <span><code>False</code></span> as soon as we find a forbidden letter; if we get to the end of the loop, we return <span><code>True</code></span>.</p>
<p><code>uses_only</code> is similar except that the sense of the condition is reversed:</p>
<pre><code>def uses_only(word, available):
    for letter in word: 
        if letter not in available:
            return False
    return True</code></pre>
<p>Instead of a list of forbidden letters, we have a list of available letters. If we find a letter in <span><code>word</code></span> that is not in <span><code>available</code></span>, we can return <span><code>False</code></span>.</p>
<p><code>uses_all</code> is similar except that we reverse the role of the word and the string of letters:</p>
<pre><code>def uses_all(word, required):
    for letter in required: 
        if letter not in word:
            return False
    return True</code></pre>
<p>Instead of traversing the letters in <span><code>word</code></span>, the loop traverses the required letters. If any of the required letters do not appear in the word, we can return <span><code>False</code></span>.</p>
<p>If you were really thinking like a computer scientist, you would have recognized that <code>uses_all</code> was an instance of a previously solved problem, and you would have written:</p>
<pre><code>def uses_all(word, required):
    return uses_only(required, word)</code></pre>
<p>This is an example of a program development plan called <span> <strong>reduction to a previously solved problem</strong></span>, which means that you recognize the problem you are working on as an instance of a solved problem and apply an existing solution.</p>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>Looping with indices</span></p>
<p>I wrote the functions in the previous section with <span><code>for</code></span> loops because I only needed the characters in the strings; I didn’t have to do anything with the indices.</p>
<p>For <code>is_abecedarian</code> we have to compare adjacent letters, which is a little tricky with a <span><code>for</code></span> loop:</p>
<pre><code>def is_abecedarian(word):
    previous = word[0]
    for c in word:
        if c &lt; previous:
            return False
        previous = c
    return True</code></pre>
<p>An alternative is to use recursion:</p>
<pre><code>def is_abecedarian(word):
    if len(word) &lt;= 1:
        return True
    if word[0] &gt; word[1]:
        return False
    return is_abecedarian(word[1:])</code></pre>
<p>Another option is to use a <span><code>while</code></span> loop:</p>
<pre><code>def is_abecedarian(word):
    i = 0
    while i &lt; len(word)-1:
        if word[i+1] &lt; word[i]:
            return False
        i = i+1
    return True</code></pre>
<p>The loop starts at <span><code>i=0</code></span> and ends when <span><code>i=len(word)-1</code></span>. Each time through the loop, it compares the <span class="math inline"><em>i</em></span>th character (which you can think of as the current character) to the <span class="math inline"><em>i</em> + 1</span>th character (which you can think of as the next).</p>
<p>If the next character is less than (alphabetically before) the current one, then we have discovered a break in the abecedarian trend, and we return <span><code>False</code></span>.</p>
<p>If we get to the end of the loop without finding a fault, then the word passes the test. To convince yourself that the loop ends correctly, consider an example like <code>'flossy'</code>. The length of the word is 6, so the last time the loop runs is when <span><code>i</code></span> is 4, which is the index of the second-to-last character. On the last iteration, it compares the second-to-last character to the last, which is what we want.</p>
<p>Here is a version of <code>is_palindrome</code> (see Exercise <a href="#palindrome" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="palindrome">[palindrome]</a>) that uses two indices; one starts at the beginning and goes up; the other starts at the end and goes down.</p>
<pre><code>def is_palindrome(word):
    i = 0
    j = len(word)-1

    while i&lt;j:
        if word[i] != word[j]:
            return False
        i = i+1
        j = j-1

    return True</code></pre>
<p>Or we could reduce to a previously solved problem and write:</p>
<pre><code>def is_palindrome(word):
    return is_reverse(word, word)</code></pre>
<p>Using <code>is_reverse</code> from Section <a href="#isreverse" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="isreverse">[isreverse]</a>.</p>

<p>Testing programs is hard. The functions in this chapter are relatively easy to test because you can check the results by hand. Even so, it is somewhere between difficult and impossible to choose a set of words that test for all possible errors.</p>
<p>Taking <code>has_no_e</code> as an example, there are two obvious cases to check: words that have an ‘e’ should return <span><code>False</code></span>, and words that don’t should return <span><code>True</code></span>. You should have no trouble coming up with one of each.</p>
<p>Within each case, there are some less obvious subcases. Among the words that have an “e”, you should test words with an “e” at the beginning, the end, and somewhere in the middle. You should test long words, short words, and very short words, like the empty string. The empty string is an example of a <span><strong>special case</strong></span>, which is one of the non-obvious cases where errors often lurk.</p>
<p>In addition to the test cases you generate, you can also test your program with a word list like <span><code>words.txt</code></span>. By scanning the output, you might be able to catch errors, but be careful: you might catch one kind of error (words that should not be included, but are) and not another (words that should be included, but aren’t).</p>
<p>In general, testing can help you find bugs, but it is not easy to generate a good set of test cases, and even if you do, you can’t be sure your program is correct. According to a legendary computer scientist:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Program testing can be used to show the presence of bugs, but never to show their absence!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Give me a word with three consecutive double letters. I’ll give you a couple of words that almost qualify, but don’t. For example, the word committee, c-o-m-m-i-t-t-e-e. It would be great except for the ‘i’ that sneaks in there. Or Mississippi: M-i-s-s-i-s-s-i-p-p-i. If you could take out those i’s it would work. But there is a word that has three consecutive pairs of letters and to the best of my knowledge this may be the only word. Of course there are probably 500 more but I can only think of one. What is the word?</p>

<p>“I was driving on the highway the other day and I happened to notice my odometer. Like most odometers, it shows six digits, in whole miles only. So, if my car had 300,000 miles, for example, I’d see 3-0-0-0-0-0.</p>
<p>“Now, what I saw that day was very interesting. I noticed that the last 4 digits were palindromic; that is, they read the same forward as backward. For example, 5-4-4-5 is a palindrome, so my odometer could have read 3-1-5-4-4-5.</p>
<p>“One mile later, the last 5 numbers were palindromic. For example, it could have read 3-6-5-4-5-6. One mile after that, the middle 4 out of 6 numbers were palindromic. And you ready for this? One mile later, all 6 were palindromic!</p>

<h1 id="lists">Lists</h1>
<p>This chapter presents one of Python’s most useful built-in types, lists. You will also learn more about objects and what can happen when you have more than one name for the same object.</p>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>A list is a sequence</span> <span id="sequence" label="sequence">[sequence]</span></p>
<p>Like a string, a <span><strong>list</strong></span> is a sequence of values. In a string, the values are characters; in a list, they can be any type. The values in a list are called <span><strong>elements</strong></span> or sometimes <span><strong>items</strong></span>.</p>
<p>There are several ways to create a new list; the simplest is to enclose the elements in square brackets (<code>[</code> and <code>]</code>):</p>
<pre><code>[10, 20, 30, 40]
[&#39;crunchy frog&#39;, &#39;ram bladder&#39;, &#39;lark vomit&#39;]</code></pre>
<p>The first example is a list of four integers. The second is a list of three strings. The elements of a list don’t have to be the same type. The following list contains a string, a float, an integer, and (lo!) another list:</p>
<pre><code>[&#39;spam&#39;, 2.0, 5, [10, 20]]</code></pre>
<p>A list within another list is <span><strong>nested</strong></span>.</p>
<p>A list that contains no elements is called an empty list; you can create one with empty brackets, <code>[]</code>.</p>
<p>As you might expect, you can assign list values to variables:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; cheeses = [&#39;Cheddar&#39;, &#39;Edam&#39;, &#39;Gouda&#39;]
&gt;&gt;&gt; numbers = [42, 123]
&gt;&gt;&gt; empty = []
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(cheeses, numbers, empty)
[&#39;Cheddar&#39;, &#39;Edam&#39;, &#39;Gouda&#39;] [42, 123] []</code></pre>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>Lists are mutable</span> <span id="mutable" label="mutable">[mutable]</span></p>
<p>The syntax for accessing the elements of a list is the same as for accessing the characters of a string—the bracket operator. The expression inside the brackets specifies the index. Remember that the indices start at 0:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; cheeses[0]
&#39;Cheddar&#39;</code></pre>
<p>Unlike strings, lists are mutable. When the bracket operator appears on the left side of an assignment, it identifies the element of the list that will be assigned.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; numbers = [42, 123]
&gt;&gt;&gt; numbers[1] = 5
&gt;&gt;&gt; numbers
[42, 5]</code></pre>
<p>The one-eth element of <span><code>numbers</code></span>, which used to be 123, is now 5.</p>
<p>Figure <a href="#fig.liststate" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig.liststate">11.1</a> shows the state diagram for <span><code> cheeses</code></span>, <span><code>numbers</code></span> and <span><code>empty</code></span>.</p>
<figure>
<embed src="figs/liststate.pdf" id="fig.liststate" /><figcaption>State diagram.<span label="fig.liststate"></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Lists are represented by boxes with the word “list” outside and the elements of the list inside. <span><code>cheeses</code></span> refers to a list with three elements indexed 0, 1 and 2. <span><code>numbers</code></span> contains two elements; the diagram shows that the value of the second element has been reassigned from 123 to 5. <span><code>empty</code></span> refers to a list with no elements.</p>
<p>List indices work the same way as string indices:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Any integer expression can be used as an index.</p></li>
<li><p>If you try to read or write an element that does not exist, you get an <span><code>IndexError</code></span>.</p></li>
<li><p>If an index has a negative value, it counts backward from the end of the list.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The <span><code>in</code></span> operator also works on lists.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; cheeses = [&#39;Cheddar&#39;, &#39;Edam&#39;, &#39;Gouda&#39;]
&gt;&gt;&gt; &#39;Edam&#39; in cheeses
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; &#39;Brie&#39; in cheeses
False</code></pre>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>Traversing a list</span></p>
<p>The most common way to traverse the elements of a list is with a <span><code>for</code></span> loop. The syntax is the same as for strings:</p>
<pre><code>for cheese in cheeses:
    print(cheese)</code></pre>
<p>This works well if you only need to read the elements of the list. But if you want to write or update the elements, you need the indices. A common way to do that is to combine the built-in functions <span><code>range</code></span> and <span><code>len</code></span>:</p>
<pre><code>for i in range(len(numbers)):
    numbers[i] = numbers[i] * 2</code></pre>
<p>This loop traverses the list and updates each element. <span><code>len</code></span> returns the number of elements in the list. <span><code>range</code></span> returns a list of indices from 0 to <span class="math inline"><em>n</em> − 1</span>, where <span class="math inline"><em>n</em></span> is the length of the list. Each time through the loop <span><code>i</code></span> gets the index of the next element. The assignment statement in the body uses <span><code>i</code></span> to read the old value of the element and to assign the new value.</p>
<p>A <span><code>for</code></span> loop over an empty list never runs the body:</p>
<pre><code>for x in []:
    print(&#39;This never happens.&#39;)</code></pre>
<p>Although a list can contain another list, the nested list still counts as a single element. The length of this list is four:</p>
<pre><code>[&#39;spam&#39;, 1, [&#39;Brie&#39;, &#39;Roquefort&#39;, &#39;Pol le Veq&#39;], [1, 2, 3]]</code></pre>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>List operations</span></p>
<p>The <span><code>+</code></span> operator concatenates lists:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a = [1, 2, 3]
&gt;&gt;&gt; b = [4, 5, 6]
&gt;&gt;&gt; c = a + b
&gt;&gt;&gt; c
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]</code></pre>
<p>The <span><code></code></span> operator repeats a list a given number of times:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; [0] * 4
[0, 0, 0, 0]
&gt;&gt;&gt; [1, 2, 3] * 3
[1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]</code></pre>
<p>The first example repeats <span><code>[0]</code></span> four times. The second example repeats the list <span><code>[1, 2, 3]</code></span> three times.</p>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>List slices</span></p>
<p>The slice operator also works on lists:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; t = [&#39;a&#39;, &#39;b&#39;, &#39;c&#39;, &#39;d&#39;, &#39;e&#39;, &#39;f&#39;]
&gt;&gt;&gt; t[1:3]
[&#39;b&#39;, &#39;c&#39;]
&gt;&gt;&gt; t[:4]
[&#39;a&#39;, &#39;b&#39;, &#39;c&#39;, &#39;d&#39;]
&gt;&gt;&gt; t[3:]
[&#39;d&#39;, &#39;e&#39;, &#39;f&#39;]</code></pre>
<p>If you omit the first index, the slice starts at the beginning. If you omit the second, the slice goes to the end. So if you omit both, the slice is a copy of the whole list.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; t[:]
[&#39;a&#39;, &#39;b&#39;, &#39;c&#39;, &#39;d&#39;, &#39;e&#39;, &#39;f&#39;]</code></pre>
<p>Since lists are mutable, it is often useful to make a copy before performing operations that modify lists.</p>
<p>A slice operator on the left side of an assignment can update multiple elements:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; t = [&#39;a&#39;, &#39;b&#39;, &#39;c&#39;, &#39;d&#39;, &#39;e&#39;, &#39;f&#39;]
&gt;&gt;&gt; t[1:3] = [&#39;x&#39;, &#39;y&#39;]
&gt;&gt;&gt; t
[&#39;a&#39;, &#39;x&#39;, &#39;y&#39;, &#39;d&#39;, &#39;e&#39;, &#39;f&#39;]</code></pre>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>List methods</span></p>
<p>Python provides methods that operate on lists. For example, <span><code>append</code></span> adds a new element to the end of a list:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; t = [&#39;a&#39;, &#39;b&#39;, &#39;c&#39;]
&gt;&gt;&gt; t.append(&#39;d&#39;)
&gt;&gt;&gt; t
[&#39;a&#39;, &#39;b&#39;, &#39;c&#39;, &#39;d&#39;]</code></pre>
<p><span><code>extend</code></span> takes a list as an argument and appends all of the elements:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; t1 = [&#39;a&#39;, &#39;b&#39;, &#39;c&#39;]
&gt;&gt;&gt; t2 = [&#39;d&#39;, &#39;e&#39;]
&gt;&gt;&gt; t1.extend(t2)
&gt;&gt;&gt; t1
[&#39;a&#39;, &#39;b&#39;, &#39;c&#39;, &#39;d&#39;, &#39;e&#39;]</code></pre>
<p>This example leaves <span><code>t2</code></span> unmodified.</p>
<p><span><code>sort</code></span> arranges the elements of the list from low to high:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; t = [&#39;d&#39;, &#39;c&#39;, &#39;e&#39;, &#39;b&#39;, &#39;a&#39;]
&gt;&gt;&gt; t.sort()
&gt;&gt;&gt; t
[&#39;a&#39;, &#39;b&#39;, &#39;c&#39;, &#39;d&#39;, &#39;e&#39;]</code></pre>
<p>Most list methods are void; they modify the list and return <span><code>None</code></span>. If you accidentally write <span><code>t = t.sort()</code></span>, you will be disappointed with the result.</p>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>Map, filter and reduce</span> <span id="filter" label="filter">[filter]</span></p>
<p>To add up all the numbers in a list, you can use a loop like this:</p>
<pre><code>def add_all(t):
    total = 0
    for x in t:
        total += x
    return total</code></pre>
<p><span><code>total</code></span> is initialized to 0. Each time through the loop, <span><code>x</code></span> gets one element from the list. The <span><code>+=</code></span> operator provides a short way to update a variable. This <span><strong>augmented assignment statement</strong></span>,</p>
<pre><code>    total += x</code></pre>
<p>is equivalent to</p>
<pre><code>    total = total + x</code></pre>
<p>As the loop runs, <span><code>total</code></span> accumulates the sum of the elements; a variable used this way is sometimes called an <span><strong>accumulator</strong></span>.</p>
<p>Adding up the elements of a list is such a common operation that Python provides it as a built-in function, <span><code>sum</code></span>:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; t = [1, 2, 3]
&gt;&gt;&gt; sum(t)
6</code></pre>
<p>An operation like this that combines a sequence of elements into a single value is sometimes called <span><strong>reduce</strong></span>.</p>
<p>Sometimes you want to traverse one list while building another. For example, the following function takes a list of strings and returns a new list that contains capitalized strings:</p>
<pre><code>def capitalize_all(t):
    res = []
    for s in t:
        res.append(s.capitalize())
    return res</code></pre>
<p><span><code>res</code></span> is initialized with an empty list; each time through the loop, we append the next element. So <span><code>res</code></span> is another kind of accumulator.</p>
<p>An operation like <code>capitalize_all</code> is sometimes called a <span> <strong>map</strong></span> because it “maps” a function (in this case the method <span><code> capitalize</code></span>) onto each of the elements in a sequence.</p>
<p>Another common operation is to select some of the elements from a list and return a sublist. For example, the following function takes a list of strings and returns a list that contains only the uppercase strings:</p>
<pre><code>def only_upper(t):
    res = []
    for s in t:
        if s.isupper():
            res.append(s)
    return res</code></pre>
<p><span><code>isupper</code></span> is a string method that returns <span><code>True</code></span> if the string contains only upper case letters.</p>
<p>An operation like <code>only_upper</code> is called a <span><strong>filter</strong></span> because it selects some of the elements and filters out the others.</p>
<p>Most common list operations can be expressed as a combination of map, filter and reduce.</p>

<p>There are several ways to delete elements from a list. If you know the index of the element you want, you can use <span><code>pop</code></span>:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; t = [&#39;a&#39;, &#39;b&#39;, &#39;c&#39;]
&gt;&gt;&gt; x = t.pop(1)
&gt;&gt;&gt; t
[&#39;a&#39;, &#39;c&#39;]
&gt;&gt;&gt; x
&#39;b&#39;</code></pre>
<p><span><code>pop</code></span> modifies the list and returns the element that was removed. If you don’t provide an index, it deletes and returns the last element.</p>
<p>If you don’t need the removed value, you can use the <span><code>del</code></span> operator:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; t = [&#39;a&#39;, &#39;b&#39;, &#39;c&#39;]
&gt;&gt;&gt; del t[1]
&gt;&gt;&gt; t
[&#39;a&#39;, &#39;c&#39;]</code></pre>
<p>If you know the element you want to remove (but not the index), you can use <span><code>remove</code></span>:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; t = [&#39;a&#39;, &#39;b&#39;, &#39;c&#39;]
&gt;&gt;&gt; t.remove(&#39;b&#39;)
&gt;&gt;&gt; t
[&#39;a&#39;, &#39;c&#39;]</code></pre>
<p>The return value from <span><code>remove</code></span> is <span><code>None</code></span>.</p>
<p>To remove more than one element, you can use <span><code>del</code></span> with a slice index:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; t = [&#39;a&#39;, &#39;b&#39;, &#39;c&#39;, &#39;d&#39;, &#39;e&#39;, &#39;f&#39;]
&gt;&gt;&gt; del t[1:5]
&gt;&gt;&gt; t
[&#39;a&#39;, &#39;f&#39;]</code></pre>
<p>As usual, the slice selects all the elements up to but not including the second index.</p>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>Lists and strings</span></p>
<p>A string is a sequence of characters and a list is a sequence of values, but a list of characters is not the same as a string. To convert from a string to a list of characters, you can use <span><code>list</code></span>:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; s = &#39;spam&#39;
&gt;&gt;&gt; t = list(s)
&gt;&gt;&gt; t
[&#39;s&#39;, &#39;p&#39;, &#39;a&#39;, &#39;m&#39;]</code></pre>
<p>Because <span><code>list</code></span> is the name of a built-in function, you should avoid using it as a variable name. I also avoid <span><code>l</code></span> because it looks too much like <span><code>1</code></span>. So that’s why I use <span><code>t</code></span>.</p>
<p>The <span><code>list</code></span> function breaks a string into individual letters. If you want to break a string into words, you can use the <span><code>split</code></span> method:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; s = &#39;pining for the fjords&#39;
&gt;&gt;&gt; t = s.split()
&gt;&gt;&gt; t
[&#39;pining&#39;, &#39;for&#39;, &#39;the&#39;, &#39;fjords&#39;]</code></pre>
<p>An optional argument called a <span><strong>delimiter</strong></span> specifies which characters to use as word boundaries. The following example uses a hyphen as a delimiter:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; s = &#39;spam-spam-spam&#39;
&gt;&gt;&gt; delimiter = &#39;-&#39;
&gt;&gt;&gt; t = s.split(delimiter)
&gt;&gt;&gt; t
[&#39;spam&#39;, &#39;spam&#39;, &#39;spam&#39;]</code></pre>
<p><span><code>join</code></span> is the inverse of <span><code>split</code></span>. It takes a list of strings and concatenates the elements. <span><code>join</code></span> is a string method, so you have to invoke it on the delimiter and pass the list as a parameter:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; t = [&#39;pining&#39;, &#39;for&#39;, &#39;the&#39;, &#39;fjords&#39;]
&gt;&gt;&gt; delimiter = &#39; &#39;
&gt;&gt;&gt; s = delimiter.join(t)
&gt;&gt;&gt; s
&#39;pining for the fjords&#39;</code></pre>
<p>In this case the delimiter is a space character, so <span><code>join</code></span> puts a space between words. To concatenate strings without spaces, you can use the empty string, <code>''</code>, as a delimiter.</p>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>Objects and values</span> <span id="equivalence" label="equivalence">[equivalence]</span></p>
<p>If we run these assignment statements:</p>
<pre><code>a = &#39;banana&#39;
b = &#39;banana&#39;</code></pre>
<p>We know that <span><code>a</code></span> and <span><code>b</code></span> both refer to a string, but we don’t know whether they refer to the <span><em>same</em></span> string. There are two possible states, shown in Figure <a href="#fig.list1" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig.list1">11.2</a>.</p>
<figure>
<embed src="figs/list1.pdf" id="fig.list1" /><figcaption>State diagram.<span label="fig.list1"></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In one case, <span><code>a</code></span> and <span><code>b</code></span> refer to two different objects that have the same value. In the second case, they refer to the same object.</p>
<p>To check whether two variables refer to the same object, you can use the <span><code>is</code></span> operator.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a = &#39;banana&#39;
&gt;&gt;&gt; b = &#39;banana&#39;
&gt;&gt;&gt; a is b
True</code></pre>
<p>In this example, Python only created one string object, and both <span><code> a</code></span> and <span><code>b</code></span> refer to it. But when you create two lists, you get two objects:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a = [1, 2, 3]
&gt;&gt;&gt; b = [1, 2, 3]
&gt;&gt;&gt; a is b
False</code></pre>
<p>So the state diagram looks like Figure <a href="#fig.list2" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig.list2">11.3</a>.</p>
<figure>
<embed src="figs/list2.pdf" id="fig.list2" /><figcaption>State diagram.<span label="fig.list2"></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In this case we would say that the two lists are <span><strong>equivalent</strong></span>, because they have the same elements, but not <span><strong>identical</strong></span>, because they are not the same object. If two objects are identical, they are also equivalent, but if they are equivalent, they are not necessarily identical.</p>
<p>Until now, we have been using “object” and “value” interchangeably, but it is more precise to say that an object has a value. If you evaluate <span><code>[1, 2, 3]</code></span>, you get a list object whose value is a sequence of integers. If another list has the same elements, we say it has the same value, but it is not the same object.</p>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>Aliasing</span></p>
<p>If <span><code>a</code></span> refers to an object and you assign <span><code>b = a</code></span>, then both variables refer to the same object:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a = [1, 2, 3]
&gt;&gt;&gt; b = a
&gt;&gt;&gt; b is a
True</code></pre>
<p>The state diagram looks like Figure <a href="#fig.list3" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig.list3">11.4</a>.</p>
<figure>
<embed src="figs/list3.pdf" id="fig.list3" /><figcaption>State diagram.<span label="fig.list3"></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The association of a variable with an object is called a <span> <strong>reference</strong></span>. In this example, there are two references to the same object.</p>
<p>An object with more than one reference has more than one name, so we say that the object is <span><strong>aliased</strong></span>.</p>
<p>If the aliased object is mutable, changes made with one alias affect the other:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; b[0] = 42
&gt;&gt;&gt; a
[42, 2, 3]</code></pre>
<p>Although this behavior can be useful, it is error-prone. In general, it is safer to avoid aliasing when you are working with mutable objects.</p>
<p>For immutable objects like strings, aliasing is not as much of a problem. In this example:</p>
<pre><code>a = &#39;banana&#39;
b = &#39;banana&#39;</code></pre>
<p>It almost never makes a difference whether <span><code>a</code></span> and <span><code>b</code></span> refer to the same string or not.</p>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>List arguments</span> <span id="list.arguments" label="list.arguments">[list.arguments]</span></p>
<p>When you pass a list to a function, the function gets a reference to the list. If the function modifies the list, the caller sees the change. For example, <code>delete_head</code> removes the first element from a list:</p>
<pre><code>def delete_head(t):
    del t[0]</code></pre>
<p>Here’s how it is used:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; letters = [&#39;a&#39;, &#39;b&#39;, &#39;c&#39;]
&gt;&gt;&gt; delete_head(letters)
&gt;&gt;&gt; letters
[&#39;b&#39;, &#39;c&#39;]</code></pre>
<p>The parameter <span><code>t</code></span> and the variable <span><code>letters</code></span> are aliases for the same object. The stack diagram looks like Figure <a href="#fig.stack5" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig.stack5">11.5</a>.</p>
<figure>
<embed src="figs/stack5.pdf" id="fig.stack5" /><figcaption>Stack diagram.<span label="fig.stack5"></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Since the list is shared by two frames, I drew it between them.</p>
<p>It is important to distinguish between operations that modify lists and operations that create new lists. For example, the <span><code>append</code></span> method modifies a list, but the <span><code>+</code></span> operator creates a new list.</p>
<p>Here’s an example using <span><code>append</code></span>:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; t1 = [1, 2]
&gt;&gt;&gt; t2 = t1.append(3)
&gt;&gt;&gt; t1
[1, 2, 3]
&gt;&gt;&gt; t2
None</code></pre>
<p>The return value from <span><code>append</code></span> is <span><code>None</code></span>.</p>
<p>Here’s an example using the <span><code>+</code></span> operator:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; t3 = t1 + [4]
&gt;&gt;&gt; t1
[1, 2, 3]
&gt;&gt;&gt; t3
[1, 2, 3, 4]</code></pre>
<p>The result of the operator is a new list, and the original list is unchanged.</p>
<p>This difference is important when you write functions that are supposed to modify lists. For example, this function <span><em>does not</em></span> delete the head of a list:</p>
<pre><code>def bad_delete_head(t):
    t = t[1:]              # WRONG!</code></pre>
<p>The slice operator creates a new list and the assignment makes <span><code>t</code></span> refer to it, but that doesn’t affect the caller.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; t4 = [1, 2, 3]
&gt;&gt;&gt; bad_delete_head(t4)
&gt;&gt;&gt; t4
[1, 2, 3]</code></pre>
<p>At the beginning of <code>bad_delete_head</code>, <span><code>t</code></span> and <span><code>t4</code></span> refer to the same list. At the end, <span><code>t</code></span> refers to a new list, but <span><code>t4</code></span> still refers to the original, unmodified list.</p>
<p>An alternative is to write a function that creates and returns a new list. For example, <span><code>tail</code></span> returns all but the first element of a list:</p>
<pre><code>def tail(t):
    return t[1:]</code></pre>
<p>This function leaves the original list unmodified. Here’s how it is used:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; letters = [&#39;a&#39;, &#39;b&#39;, &#39;c&#39;]
&gt;&gt;&gt; rest = tail(letters)
&gt;&gt;&gt; rest
[&#39;b&#39;, &#39;c&#39;]</code></pre>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>Debugging</span></p>
<p>Careless use of lists (and other mutable objects) can lead to long hours of debugging. Here are some common pitfalls and ways to avoid them:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Most list methods modify the argument and return <span><code>None</code></span>. This is the opposite of the string methods, which return a new string and leave the original alone.</p>
<p>If you are used to writing string code like this:</p>
<pre><code>word = word.strip()</code></pre>
<p>It is tempting to write list code like this:</p>
<pre><code>t = t.sort()           # WRONG!</code></pre>
<p>Because <span><code>sort</code></span> returns <span><code>None</code></span>, the next operation you perform with <span><code>t</code></span> is likely to fail.</p>
<p>Before using list methods and operators, you should read the documentation carefully and then test them in interactive mode.</p></li>
<li><p>Pick an idiom and stick with it.</p>
<p>Part of the problem with lists is that there are too many ways to do things. For example, to remove an element from a list, you can use <span><code>pop</code></span>, <span><code>remove</code></span>, <span><code>del</code></span>, or even a slice assignment.</p>
<p>To add an element, you can use the <span><code>append</code></span> method or the <span><code>+</code></span> operator. Assuming that <span><code>t</code></span> is a list and <span><code>x</code></span> is a list element, these are correct:</p>
<pre><code>t.append(x)
t = t + [x]
t += [x]</code></pre>
<p>And these are wrong:</p>
<pre><code>t.append([x])          # WRONG!
t = t.append(x)        # WRONG!
t + [x]                # WRONG!
t = t + x              # WRONG!</code></pre>
<p>Try out each of these examples in interactive mode to make sure you understand what they do. Notice that only the last one causes a runtime error; the other three are legal, but they do the wrong thing.</p></li>
<li><p>Make copies to avoid aliasing.</p>
<p>If you want to use a method like <span><code>sort</code></span> that modifies the argument, but you need to keep the original list as well, you can make a copy.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; t = [3, 1, 2]
&gt;&gt;&gt; t2 = t[:]
&gt;&gt;&gt; t2.sort()
&gt;&gt;&gt; t
[3, 1, 2]
&gt;&gt;&gt; t2
[1, 2, 3]</code></pre>
<p>In this example you could also use the built-in function <span><code>sorted</code></span>, which returns a new, sorted list and leaves the original alone.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; t2 = sorted(t)
&gt;&gt;&gt; t
[3, 1, 2]
&gt;&gt;&gt; t2
[1, 2, 3]</code></pre></li>

<p>If there are 23 students in your class, what are the chances that two of you have the same birthday?

Hint: you can generate random birthdays with the <span><code>randint</code></span> function in the <span><code>random</code></span> module.</p>

<p>Write a function that reads the file <span><code>words.txt</code></span> and builds a list with one element per word. Write two versions of this function, one using the <span><code>append</code></span> method and the other using the idiom <span><code>t = t + [x]</code></span>. Which one takes longer to run? Why?</p>

<p>To check whether a word is in the word list, you could use the <span><code>in</code></span> operator, but it would be slow because it searches through the words in order.</p>
<p>Because the words are in alphabetical order, we can speed things up with a bisection search (also known as binary search), which is similar to what you do when you look a word up in the dictionary (the book, not the data structure). You start in the middle and check to see whether the word you are looking for comes before the word in the middle of the list. If so, you search the first half of the list the same way. Otherwise you search the second half.</p>
<p>Either way, you cut the remaining search space in half. If the word list has 113,809 words, it will take about 17 steps to find the word or conclude that it’s not there.</p>
<p>Write a function called <code>in_bisect</code> that takes a sorted list and a target value and returns <span><code>True</code></span> if the word is in the list and <span><code>False</code></span> if it’s not.</p>
<p>Or you could read the documentation of the <span><code>bisect</code></span> module and use that! Solution: <a href="http://thinkpython2.com/code/inlist.py">http://thinkpython2.com/code/inlist.py</a>.</p>

<h1 id="dictionaries">Dictionaries</h1>
<p>This chapter presents another built-in type called a dictionary. Dictionaries are one of Python’s best features; they are the building blocks of many efficient and elegant algorithms.</p>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>A dictionary is a mapping</span></p>
<p>A <span><strong>dictionary</strong></span> is like a list, but more general. In a list, the indices have to be integers; in a dictionary they can be (almost) any type.</p>
<p>A dictionary contains a collection of indices, which are called <span> <strong>keys</strong></span>, and a collection of values. Each key is associated with a single value. The association of a key and a value is called a <span> <strong>key-value pair</strong></span> or sometimes an <span><strong>item</strong></span>.</p>
<p>In mathematical language, a dictionary represents a <span><strong>mapping</strong></span> from keys to values, so you can also say that each key “maps to” a value. As an example, we’ll build a dictionary that maps from English to Spanish words, so the keys and the values are all strings.</p>
<p>The function <span><code>dict</code></span> creates a new dictionary with no items. Because <span><code>dict</code></span> is the name of a built-in function, you should avoid using it as a variable name.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; eng2sp = dict()
&gt;&gt;&gt; eng2sp
{}</code></pre>
<p>The squiggly-brackets, <code>{}</code>, represent an empty dictionary. To add items to the dictionary, you can use square brackets:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; eng2sp[&#39;one&#39;] = &#39;uno&#39;</code></pre>
<p>This line creates an item that maps from the key <code>'one'</code> to the value <code>'uno'</code>. If we print the dictionary again, we see a key-value pair with a colon between the key and value:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; eng2sp
{&#39;one&#39;: &#39;uno&#39;}</code></pre>
<p>This output format is also an input format. For example, you can create a new dictionary with three items:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; eng2sp = {&#39;one&#39;: &#39;uno&#39;, &#39;two&#39;: &#39;dos&#39;, &#39;three&#39;: &#39;tres&#39;}</code></pre>
<p>But if you print <span><code>eng2sp</code></span>, you might be surprised:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; eng2sp
{&#39;one&#39;: &#39;uno&#39;, &#39;three&#39;: &#39;tres&#39;, &#39;two&#39;: &#39;dos&#39;}</code></pre>
<p>The order of the key-value pairs might not be the same. If you type the same example on your computer, you might get a different result. In general, the order of items in a dictionary is unpredictable.</p>
<p>But that’s not a problem because the elements of a dictionary are never indexed with integer indices. Instead, you use the keys to look up the corresponding values:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; eng2sp[&#39;two&#39;]
&#39;dos&#39;</code></pre>
<p>The key <code>'two'</code> always maps to the value <code>'dos'</code> so the order of the items doesn’t matter.</p>
<p>If the key isn’t in the dictionary, you get an exception:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; eng2sp[&#39;four&#39;]
KeyError: &#39;four&#39;</code></pre>
<p>The <span><code>len</code></span> function works on dictionaries; it returns the number of key-value pairs:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; len(eng2sp)
3</code></pre>
<p>The <span><code>in</code></span> operator works on dictionaries, too; it tells you whether something appears as a <span><em>key</em></span> in the dictionary (appearing as a value is not good enough).</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; &#39;one&#39; in eng2sp
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; &#39;uno&#39; in eng2sp
False</code></pre>
<p>To see whether something appears as a value in a dictionary, you can use the method <span><code>values</code></span>, which returns a collection of values, and then use the <span><code>in</code></span> operator:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; vals = eng2sp.values()
&gt;&gt;&gt; &#39;uno&#39; in vals
True</code></pre>
<p>The <span><code>in</code></span> operator uses different algorithms for lists and dictionaries. For lists, it searches the elements of the list in order, as in Section <a href="#find" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="find">[find]</a>. As the list gets longer, the search time gets longer in direct proportion.</p>
<p>Python dictionaries use a data structure called a <span><strong>hashtable</strong></span> that has a remarkable property: the <span><code>in</code></span> operator takes about the same amount of time no matter how many items are in the dictionary. I explain how that’s possible in Section <a href="#hashtable" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="hashtable">[hashtable]</a>, but the explanation might not make sense until you’ve read a few more chapters.</p>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>Dictionary as a collection of counters</span> <span id="histogram" label="histogram">[histogram]</span></p>
<p>Suppose you are given a string and you want to count how many times each letter appears. There are several ways you could do it:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>You could create 26 variables, one for each letter of the alphabet. Then you could traverse the string and, for each character, increment the corresponding counter, probably using a chained conditional.</p></li>
<li><p>You could create a list with 26 elements. Then you could convert each character to a number (using the built-in function <span><code>ord</code></span>), use the number as an index into the list, and increment the appropriate counter.</p></li>
<li><p>You could create a dictionary with characters as keys and counters as the corresponding values. The first time you see a character, you would add an item to the dictionary. After that you would increment the value of an existing item.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Each of these options performs the same computation, but each of them implements that computation in a different way.</p>
<p>An <span><strong>implementation</strong></span> is a way of performing a computation; some implementations are better than others. For example, an advantage of the dictionary implementation is that we don’t have to know ahead of time which letters appear in the string and we only have to make room for the letters that do appear.</p>
<p>Here is what the code might look like:</p>
<pre><code>def histogram(s):
    d = dict()
    for c in s:
        if c not in d:
            d[c] = 1
        else:
            d[c] += 1
    return d</code></pre>
<p>The name of the function is <span><code>histogram</code></span>, which is a statistical term for a collection of counters (or frequencies).</p>
<p>The first line of the function creates an empty dictionary. The <span><code>for</code></span> loop traverses the string. Each time through the loop, if the character <span><code>c</code></span> is not in the dictionary, we create a new item with key <span><code>c</code></span> and the initial value 1 (since we have seen this letter once). If <span><code>c</code></span> is already in the dictionary we increment <span><code>d[c]</code></span>.</p>
<p>Here’s how it works:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; h = histogram(&#39;brontosaurus&#39;)
&gt;&gt;&gt; h
{&#39;a&#39;: 1, &#39;b&#39;: 1, &#39;o&#39;: 2, &#39;n&#39;: 1, &#39;s&#39;: 2, &#39;r&#39;: 2, &#39;u&#39;: 2, &#39;t&#39;: 1}</code></pre>
<p>The histogram indicates that the letters <code>'a'</code> and <code>'b'</code> appear once; <code>'o'</code> appears twice, and so on.</p>
<p>Dictionaries have a method called <span><code>get</code></span> that takes a key and a default value. If the key appears in the dictionary, <span><code>get</code></span> returns the corresponding value; otherwise it returns the default value. For example:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; h = histogram(&#39;a&#39;)
&gt;&gt;&gt; h
{&#39;a&#39;: 1}
&gt;&gt;&gt; h.get(&#39;a&#39;, 0)
1
&gt;&gt;&gt; h.get(&#39;c&#39;, 0)
0</code></pre>
<p>As an exercise, use <span><code>get</code></span> to write <span><code>histogram</code></span> more concisely. You should be able to eliminate the <span><code>if</code></span> statement.</p>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>Looping and dictionaries</span></p>
<p>If you use a dictionary in a <span><code>for</code></span> statement, it traverses the keys of the dictionary. For example, <code>print_hist</code> prints each key and the corresponding value:</p>
<pre><code>def print_hist(h):
    for c in h:
        print(c, h[c])</code></pre>
<p>Here’s what the output looks like:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; h = histogram(&#39;parrot&#39;)
&gt;&gt;&gt; print_hist(h)
a 1
p 1
r 2
t 1
o 1</code></pre>
<p>Again, the keys are in no particular order. To traverse the keys in sorted order, you can use the built-in function <span><code>sorted</code></span>:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; for key in sorted(h):
...     print(key, h[key])
a 1
o 1
p 1
r 2
t 1</code></pre>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>Reverse lookup</span> <span id="raise" label="raise">[raise]</span></p>
<p>Given a dictionary <span><code>d</code></span> and a key <span><code>k</code></span>, it is easy to find the corresponding value <span><code>v = d[k]</code></span>. This operation is called a <span><strong>lookup</strong></span>.</p>
<p>But what if you have <span><code>v</code></span> and you want to find <span><code>k</code></span>? You have two problems: first, there might be more than one key that maps to the value <span><code>v</code></span>. Depending on the application, you might be able to pick one, or you might have to make a list that contains all of them. Second, there is no simple syntax to do a <span><strong>reverse lookup</strong></span>; you have to search.</p>
<p>Here is a function that takes a value and returns the first key that maps to that value:</p>
<pre><code>def reverse_lookup(d, v):
    for k in d:
        if d[k] == v:
            return k
    raise LookupError()</code></pre>
<p>This function is yet another example of the search pattern, but it uses a feature we haven’t seen before, <span><code>raise</code></span>. The <span><strong>raise statement</strong></span> causes an exception; in this case it causes a <span><code>LookupError</code></span>, which is a built-in exception used to indicate that a lookup operation failed.</p>
<p>If we get to the end of the loop, that means <span><code>v</code></span> doesn’t appear in the dictionary as a value, so we raise an exception.</p>
<p>Here is an example of a successful reverse lookup:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; h = histogram(&#39;parrot&#39;)
&gt;&gt;&gt; key = reverse_lookup(h, 2)
&gt;&gt;&gt; key
&#39;r&#39;</code></pre>
<p>And an unsuccessful one:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; key = reverse_lookup(h, 3)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File &quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;, line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
  File &quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;, line 5, in reverse_lookup
LookupError</code></pre>
<p>The effect when you raise an exception is the same as when Python raises one: it prints a traceback and an error message.</p>
<p>When you raise an exception, you can provide a detailed error message as an optional argument. For example:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; raise LookupError(&#39;value does not appear in the dictionary&#39;)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File &quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;, line 1, in ?
LookupError: value does not appear in the dictionary</code></pre>
<p>A reverse lookup is much slower than a forward lookup; if you have to do it often, or if the dictionary gets big, the performance of your program will suffer.</p>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>Dictionaries and lists</span> <span id="invert" label="invert">[invert]</span></p>
<p>Lists can appear as values in a dictionary. For example, if you are given a dictionary that maps from letters to frequencies, you might want to invert it; that is, create a dictionary that maps from frequencies to letters. Since there might be several letters with the same frequency, each value in the inverted dictionary should be a list of letters.</p>
<p>Here is a function that inverts a dictionary:</p>
<pre><code>def invert_dict(d):
    inverse = dict()
    for key in d:
        val = d[key]
        if val not in inverse:
            inverse[val] = [key]
        else:
            inverse[val].append(key)
    return inverse</code></pre>
<p>Each time through the loop, <span><code>key</code></span> gets a key from <span><code>d</code></span> and <span><code>val</code></span> gets the corresponding value. If <span><code>val</code></span> is not in <span><code> inverse</code></span>, that means we haven’t seen it before, so we create a new item and initialize it with a <span><strong>singleton</strong></span> (a list that contains a single element). Otherwise we have seen this value before, so we append the corresponding key to the list.</p>
<p>Here is an example:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; hist = histogram(&#39;parrot&#39;)
&gt;&gt;&gt; hist
{&#39;a&#39;: 1, &#39;p&#39;: 1, &#39;r&#39;: 2, &#39;t&#39;: 1, &#39;o&#39;: 1}
&gt;&gt;&gt; inverse = invert_dict(hist)
&gt;&gt;&gt; inverse
{1: [&#39;a&#39;, &#39;p&#39;, &#39;t&#39;, &#39;o&#39;], 2: [&#39;r&#39;]}</code></pre>

<p>Figure <a href="#fig.dict1" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig.dict1">12.1</a> is a state diagram showing <span><code>hist</code></span> and <span><code>inverse</code></span>. A dictionary is represented as a box with the type <span><code>dict</code></span> above it and the key-value pairs inside. If the values are integers, floats or strings, I draw them inside the box, but I usually draw lists outside the box, just to keep the diagram simple.</p>
<p>Lists can be values in a dictionary, as this example shows, but they cannot be keys. Here’s what happens if you try:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; t = [1, 2, 3]
&gt;&gt;&gt; d = dict()
&gt;&gt;&gt; d[t] = &#39;oops&#39;
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File &quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;, line 1, in ?
TypeError: list objects are unhashable</code></pre>
<p>I mentioned earlier that a dictionary is implemented using a hashtable and that means that the keys have to be <span><strong>hashable</strong></span>.</p>
<p>A <span><strong>hash</strong></span> is a function that takes a value (of any kind) and returns an integer. Dictionaries use these integers, called hash values, to store and look up key-value pairs.</p>
<p>This system works fine if the keys are immutable. But if the keys are mutable, like lists, bad things happen. For example, when you create a key-value pair, Python hashes the key and stores it in the corresponding location. If you modify the key and then hash it again, it would go to a different location. In that case you might have two entries for the same key, or you might not be able to find a key. Either way, the dictionary wouldn’t work correctly.</p>
<p>That’s why keys have to be hashable, and why mutable types like lists aren’t. The simplest way to get around this limitation is to use tuples, which we will see in the next chapter.</p>
<p>Since dictionaries are mutable, they can’t be used as keys, but they <span><em>can</em></span> be used as values.</p>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>Memos</span> <span id="memoize" label="memoize">[memoize]</span></p>
<p>If you played with the <span><code>fibonacci</code></span> function from Section <a href="#one.more.example" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="one.more.example">[one.more.example]</a>, you might have noticed that the bigger the argument you provide, the longer the function takes to run. Furthermore, the run time increases quickly.</p>
<p>To understand why, consider Figure <a href="#fig.fibonacci" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig.fibonacci">12.2</a>, which shows the <span><strong>call graph</strong></span> for <span><code>fibonacci</code></span> with <span><code>n=4</code></span>:</p>
<figure>
<embed src="figs/fibonacci.pdf" id="fig.fibonacci" /><figcaption>Call graph.<span label="fig.fibonacci"></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>A call graph shows a set of function frames, with lines connecting each frame to the frames of the functions it calls. At the top of the graph, <span><code>fibonacci</code></span> with <span><code>n=4</code></span> calls <span><code>fibonacci</code></span> with <span><code> n=3</code></span> and <span><code>n=2</code></span>. In turn, <span><code>fibonacci</code></span> with <span><code>n=3</code></span> calls <span><code>fibonacci</code></span> with <span><code>n=2</code></span> and <span><code>n=1</code></span>. And so on.</p>
<p>Count how many times <span><code>fibonacci(0)</code></span> and <span><code>fibonacci(1)</code></span> are called. This is an inefficient solution to the problem, and it gets worse as the argument gets bigger.</p>
<p>One solution is to keep track of values that have already been computed by storing them in a dictionary. A previously computed value that is stored for later use is called a <span><strong>memo</strong></span>. Here is a “memoized” version of <span><code>fibonacci</code></span>:</p>
<pre><code>known = {0:0, 1:1}

def fibonacci(n):
    if n in known:
        return known[n]

    res = fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
    known[n] = res
    return res</code></pre>
<p><span><code>known</code></span> is a dictionary that keeps track of the Fibonacci numbers we already know. It starts with two items: 0 maps to 0 and 1 maps to 1.</p>
<p>Whenever <span><code>fibonacci</code></span> is called, it checks <span><code>known</code></span>. If the result is already there, it can return immediately. Otherwise it has to compute the new value, add it to the dictionary, and return it.</p>
<p>If you run this version of <span><code>fibonacci</code></span> and compare it with the original, you will find that it is much faster.</p>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>Global variables</span></p>
<p>In the previous example, <span><code>known</code></span> is created outside the function, so it belongs to the special frame called <code>__main__</code>. Variables in <code>__main__</code> are sometimes called <span><strong>global</strong></span> because they can be accessed from any function. Unlike local variables, which disappear when their function ends, global variables persist from one function call to the next.</p>
<p>It is common to use global variables for <span><strong>flags</strong></span>; that is, boolean variables that indicate (“flag”) whether a condition is true. For example, some programs use a flag named <span><code>verbose</code></span> to control the level of detail in the output:</p>
<pre><code>verbose = True

def example1():
    if verbose:
        print(&#39;Running example1&#39;)</code></pre>
<p>If you try to reassign a global variable, you might be surprised. The following example is supposed to keep track of whether the function has been called:</p>
<pre><code>been_called = False

def example2():
    been_called = True         # WRONG</code></pre>
<p>But if you run it you will see that the value of <code>been_called</code> doesn’t change. The problem is that <span><code>example2</code></span> creates a new local variable named <code>been_called</code>. The local variable goes away when the function ends, and has no effect on the global variable.</p>
<p>To reassign a global variable inside a function you have to <span><strong>declare</strong></span> the global variable before you use it:</p>
<pre><code>been_called = False

def example2():
    global been_called 
    been_called = True</code></pre>
<p>The <span><strong>global statement</strong></span> tells the interpreter something like, “In this function, when I say <code>been_called</code>, I mean the global variable; don’t create a local one.”</p>
<p>Here’s an example that tries to update a global variable:</p>
<pre><code>count = 0

def example3():
    count = count + 1          # WRONG</code></pre>
<p>If you run it you get:</p>
<pre><code>UnboundLocalError: local variable &#39;count&#39; referenced before assignment</code></pre>
<p>Python assumes that <span><code>count</code></span> is local, and under that assumption you are reading it before writing it. The solution, again, is to declare <span><code>count</code></span> global.</p>
<pre><code>def example3():
    global count
    count += 1</code></pre>
<p>If a global variable refers to a mutable value, you can modify the value without declaring the variable:</p>
<pre><code>known = {0:0, 1:1}

def example4():
    known[2] = 1</code></pre>
<p>So you can add, remove and replace elements of a global list or dictionary, but if you want to reassign the variable, you have to declare it:</p>
<pre><code>def example5():
    global known
    known = dict()</code></pre>
<p>Global variables can be useful, but if you have a lot of them, and you modify them frequently, they can make programs hard to debug.</p>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>Debugging</span></p>
<p>As you work with bigger datasets it can become unwieldy to debug by printing and checking the output by hand. Here are some suggestions for debugging large datasets:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Scale down the input:</dt>
<dd><p>If possible, reduce the size of the dataset. For example if the program reads a text file, start with just the first 10 lines, or with the smallest example you can find. You can either edit the files themselves, or (better) modify the program so it reads only the first <span><code>n</code></span> lines.</p>
<p>If there is an error, you can reduce <span><code>n</code></span> to the smallest value that manifests the error, and then increase it gradually as you find and correct errors.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Check summaries and types:</dt>
<dd><p>Instead of printing and checking the entire dataset, consider printing summaries of the data: for example, the number of items in a dictionary or the total of a list of numbers.</p>
<p>A common cause of runtime errors is a value that is not the right type. For debugging this kind of error, it is often enough to print the type of a value.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Write self-checks:</dt>
<dd><p>Sometimes you can write code to check for errors automatically. For example, if you are computing the average of a list of numbers, you could check that the result is not greater than the largest element in the list or less than the smallest. This is called a “sanity check” because it detects results that are “insane”.</p>
<p>Another kind of check compares the results of two different computations to see if they are consistent. This is called a “consistency check”.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Format the output:</dt>
<dd><p>Formatting debugging output can make it easier to spot an error. We saw an example in Section <a href="#factdebug" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="factdebug">[factdebug]</a>. Another tool you might find useful is the <span><code>pprint</code></span> module, which provides a <span><code>pprint</code></span> function that displays built-in types in a more human-readable format (<span><code>pprint</code></span> stands for “pretty print”).</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Again, time you spend building scaffolding can reduce the time you spend debugging.</p>

<p>Here’s another Puzzler from <span><em>Car Talk</em></span> (<a href="http://www.cartalk.com/content/puzzlers">http://www.cartalk.com/content/puzzlers</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This was sent in by a fellow named Dan O’Leary. He came upon a common one-syllable, five-letter word recently that has the following unique property. When you remove the first letter, the remaining letters form a homophone of the original word, that is a word that sounds exactly the same. Replace the first letter, that is, put it back and remove the second letter and the result is yet another homophone of the original word. And the question is, what’s the word?</p>
<p>Now I’m going to give you an example that doesn’t work. Let’s look at the five-letter word, ‘wrack.’ W-R-A-C-K, you know like to ‘wrack with pain.’ If I remove the first letter, I am left with a four-letter word, ’R-A-C-K.’ As in, ‘Holy cow, did you see the rack on that buck! It must have been a nine-pointer!’ It’s a perfect homophone. If you put the ‘w’ back, and remove the ‘r,’ instead, you’re left with the word, ‘wack,’ which is a real word, it’s just not a homophone of the other two words.</p>
<p>But there is, however, at least one word that Dan and we know of, which will yield two homophones if you remove either of the first two letters to make two, new four-letter words. The question is, what’s the word?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can use the dictionary from Exercise <a href="#wordlist2" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="wordlist2">[wordlist2]</a> to check whether a string is in the word list.</p>
<p>To check whether two words are homophones, you can use the CMU Pronouncing Dictionary. You can download it from <a href="http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/cmudict">http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/cmudict</a> or from <a href="http://thinkpython2.com/code/c06d">http://thinkpython2.com/code/c06d</a> and you can also download <a href="http://thinkpython2.com/code/pronounce.py">http://thinkpython2.com/code/pronounce.py</a>, which provides a function named <code>read_dictionary</code> that reads the pronouncing dictionary and returns a Python dictionary that maps from each word to a string that describes its primary pronunciation.</p>

<h1 id="tuplechap">Tuples</h1>
<p>This chapter presents one more built-in type, the tuple, and then shows how lists, dictionaries, and tuples work together. I also present a useful feature for variable-length argument lists, the gather and scatter operators.</p>
<p>One note: there is no consensus on how to pronounce “tuple”. Some people say “tuh-ple”, which rhymes with “supple”. But in the context of programming, most people say “too-ple”, which rhymes with “quadruple”.</p>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>Tuples are immutable</span></p>
<p>A tuple is a sequence of values. The values can be any type, and they are indexed by integers, so in that respect tuples are a lot like lists. The important difference is that tuples are immutable.</p>
<p>Syntactically, a tuple is a comma-separated list of values:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; t = &#39;a&#39;, &#39;b&#39;, &#39;c&#39;, &#39;d&#39;, &#39;e&#39;</code></pre>
<p>Although it is not necessary, it is common to enclose tuples in parentheses:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; t = (&#39;a&#39;, &#39;b&#39;, &#39;c&#39;, &#39;d&#39;, &#39;e&#39;)</code></pre>
<p>To create a tuple with a single element, you have to include a final comma:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; t1 = &#39;a&#39;,
&gt;&gt;&gt; type(t1)
&lt;class &#39;tuple&#39;&gt;</code></pre>
<p>A value in parentheses is not a tuple:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; t2 = (&#39;a&#39;)
&gt;&gt;&gt; type(t2)
&lt;class &#39;str&#39;&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Another way to create a tuple is the built-in function <span><code>tuple</code></span>. With no argument, it creates an empty tuple:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; t = tuple()
&gt;&gt;&gt; t
()</code></pre>
<p>If the argument is a sequence (string, list or tuple), the result is a tuple with the elements of the sequence:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; t = tuple(&#39;lupins&#39;)
&gt;&gt;&gt; t
(&#39;l&#39;, &#39;u&#39;, &#39;p&#39;, &#39;i&#39;, &#39;n&#39;, &#39;s&#39;)</code></pre>
<p>Because <span><code>tuple</code></span> is the name of a built-in function, you should avoid using it as a variable name.</p>
<p>Most list operators also work on tuples. The bracket operator indexes an element:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; t = (&#39;a&#39;, &#39;b&#39;, &#39;c&#39;, &#39;d&#39;, &#39;e&#39;)
&gt;&gt;&gt; t[0]
&#39;a&#39;</code></pre>
<p>And the slice operator selects a range of elements.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; t[1:3]
(&#39;b&#39;, &#39;c&#39;)</code></pre>
<p>But if you try to modify one of the elements of the tuple, you get an error:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; t[0] = &#39;A&#39;
TypeError: object doesn&#39;t support item assignment</code></pre>
<p>Because tuples are immutable, you can’t modify the elements. But you can replace one tuple with another:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; t = (&#39;A&#39;,) + t[1:]
&gt;&gt;&gt; t
(&#39;A&#39;, &#39;b&#39;, &#39;c&#39;, &#39;d&#39;, &#39;e&#39;)</code></pre>
<p>This statement makes a new tuple and then makes <span><code>t</code></span> refer to it.</p>
<p>The relational operators work with tuples and other sequences; Python starts by comparing the first element from each sequence. If they are equal, it goes on to the next elements, and so on, until it finds elements that differ. Subsequent elements are not considered (even if they are really big).</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; (0, 1, 2) &lt; (0, 3, 4)
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; (0, 1, 2000000) &lt; (0, 3, 4)
True</code></pre>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>Tuple assignment</span> <span id="tuple.assignment" label="tuple.assignment">[tuple.assignment]</span></p>
<p>It is often useful to swap the values of two variables. With conventional assignments, you have to use a temporary variable. For example, to swap <span><code>a</code></span> and <span><code>b</code></span>:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; temp = a
&gt;&gt;&gt; a = b
&gt;&gt;&gt; b = temp</code></pre>
<p>This solution is cumbersome; <span><strong>tuple assignment</strong></span> is more elegant:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a, b = b, a</code></pre>
<p>The left side is a tuple of variables; the right side is a tuple of expressions. Each value is assigned to its respective variable. All the expressions on the right side are evaluated before any of the assignments.</p>
<p>The number of variables on the left and the number of values on the right have to be the same:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a, b = 1, 2, 3
ValueError: too many values to unpack</code></pre>
<p>More generally, the right side can be any kind of sequence (string, list or tuple). For example, to split an email address into a user name and a domain, you could write:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; addr = &#39;monty@python.org&#39;
&gt;&gt;&gt; uname, domain = addr.split(&#39;@&#39;)</code></pre>
<p>The return value from <span><code>split</code></span> is a list with two elements; the first element is assigned to <span><code>uname</code></span>, the second to <span><code>domain</code></span>.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; uname
&#39;monty&#39;
&gt;&gt;&gt; domain
&#39;python.org&#39;</code></pre>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>Tuples as return values</span></p>
<p>Strictly speaking, a function can only return one value, but if the value is a tuple, the effect is the same as returning multiple values. For example, if you want to divide two integers and compute the quotient and remainder, it is inefficient to compute <span><code>x//y</code></span> and then <span><code>x%y</code></span>. It is better to compute them both at the same time.</p>
<p>The built-in function <span><code>divmod</code></span> takes two arguments and returns a tuple of two values, the quotient and remainder. You can store the result as a tuple:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; t = divmod(7, 3)
&gt;&gt;&gt; t
(2, 1)</code></pre>
<p>Or use tuple assignment to store the elements separately:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; quot, rem = divmod(7, 3)
&gt;&gt;&gt; quot
2
&gt;&gt;&gt; rem
1</code></pre>
<p>Here is an example of a function that returns a tuple:</p>
<pre><code>def min_max(t):
    return min(t), max(t)</code></pre>
<p><span><code>max</code></span> and <span><code>min</code></span> are built-in functions that find the largest and smallest elements of a sequence. <code>min_max</code> computes both and returns a tuple of two values.</p>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>Variable-length argument tuples</span> <span id="gather" label="gather">[gather]</span></p>
<p>Functions can take a variable number of arguments. A parameter name that begins with <span><code></code></span> <span><strong>gathers</strong></span> arguments into a tuple. For example, <span><code>printall</code></span> takes any number of arguments and prints them:</p>
<pre><code>def printall(*args):
    print(args)</code></pre>
<p>The gather parameter can have any name you like, but <span><code>args</code></span> is conventional. Here’s how the function works:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; printall(1, 2.0, &#39;3&#39;)
(1, 2.0, &#39;3&#39;)</code></pre>
<p>The complement of gather is <span><strong>scatter</strong></span>. If you have a sequence of values and you want to pass it to a function as multiple arguments, you can use the <span><code></code></span> operator. For example, <span><code>divmod</code></span> takes exactly two arguments; it doesn’t work with a tuple:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; t = (7, 3)
&gt;&gt;&gt; divmod(t)
TypeError: divmod expected 2 arguments, got 1</code></pre>
<p>But if you scatter the tuple, it works:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; divmod(*t)
(2, 1)</code></pre>
<p>Many of the built-in functions use variable-length argument tuples. For example, <span><code>max</code></span> and <span><code>min</code></span> can take any number of arguments:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; max(1, 2, 3)
3</code></pre>
<p>But <span><code>sum</code></span> does not.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; sum(1, 2, 3)
TypeError: sum expected at most 2 arguments, got 3</code></pre>
<p>As an exercise, write a function called <code>sum_all</code> that takes any number of arguments and returns their sum.</p>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>Lists and tuples</span></p>
<p><span><code>zip</code></span> is a built-in function that takes two or more sequences and interleaves them. The name of the function refers to a zipper, which interleaves two rows of teeth.</p>
<p>This example zips a string and a list:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; s = &#39;abc&#39;
&gt;&gt;&gt; t = [0, 1, 2]
&gt;&gt;&gt; zip(s, t)
&lt;zip object at 0x7f7d0a9e7c48&gt;</code></pre>
<p>The result is a <span><strong>zip object</strong></span> that knows how to iterate through the pairs. The most common use of <span><code>zip</code></span> is in a <span><code>for</code></span> loop:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; for pair in zip(s, t):
...     print(pair)
...
(&#39;a&#39;, 0)
(&#39;b&#39;, 1)
(&#39;c&#39;, 2)</code></pre>
<p>A zip object is a kind of <span><strong>iterator</strong></span>, which is any object that iterates through a sequence. Iterators are similar to lists in some ways, but unlike lists, you can’t use an index to select an element from an iterator.</p>
<p>If you want to use list operators and methods, you can use a zip object to make a list:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; list(zip(s, t))
[(&#39;a&#39;, 0), (&#39;b&#39;, 1), (&#39;c&#39;, 2)]</code></pre>
<p>The result is a list of tuples; in this example, each tuple contains a character from the string and the corresponding element from the list.</p>
<p>If the sequences are not the same length, the result has the length of the shorter one.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; list(zip(&#39;Anne&#39;, &#39;Elk&#39;))
[(&#39;A&#39;, &#39;E&#39;), (&#39;n&#39;, &#39;l&#39;), (&#39;n&#39;, &#39;k&#39;)]</code></pre>
<p>You can use tuple assignment in a <span><code>for</code></span> loop to traverse a list of tuples:</p>
<pre><code>t = [(&#39;a&#39;, 0), (&#39;b&#39;, 1), (&#39;c&#39;, 2)]
for letter, number in t:
    print(number, letter)</code></pre>
<p>Each time through the loop, Python selects the next tuple in the list and assigns the elements to <span><code>letter</code></span> and <span><code>number</code></span>. The output of this loop is:</p>
<pre><code>0 a
1 b
2 c</code></pre>
<p>If you combine <span><code>zip</code></span>, <span><code>for</code></span> and tuple assignment, you get a useful idiom for traversing two (or more) sequences at the same time. For example, <code>has_match</code> takes two sequences, <span><code>t1</code></span> and <span><code>t2</code></span>, and returns <span><code>True</code></span> if there is an index <span><code>i</code></span> such that <span><code>t1[i] == t2[i]</code></span>:</p>
<pre><code>def has_match(t1, t2):
    for x, y in zip(t1, t2):
        if x == y:
            return True
    return False</code></pre>
<p>If you need to traverse the elements of a sequence and their indices, you can use the built-in function <span><code>enumerate</code></span>:</p>
<pre><code>for index, element in enumerate(&#39;abc&#39;):
    print(index, element)</code></pre>
<p>The result from <span><code>enumerate</code></span> is an enumerate object, which iterates a sequence of pairs; each pair contains an index (starting from 0) and an element from the given sequence. In this example, the output is</p>
<pre><code>0 a
1 b
2 c</code></pre>
<p>Again.</p>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>Dictionaries and tuples</span> <span id="dictuple" label="dictuple">[dictuple]</span></p>
<p>Dictionaries have a method called <span><code>items</code></span> that returns a sequence of tuples, where each tuple is a key-value pair.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; d = {&#39;a&#39;:0, &#39;b&#39;:1, &#39;c&#39;:2}
&gt;&gt;&gt; t = d.items()
&gt;&gt;&gt; t
dict_items([(&#39;c&#39;, 2), (&#39;a&#39;, 0), (&#39;b&#39;, 1)])</code></pre>
<p>The result is a <code>dict_items</code> object, which is an iterator that iterates the key-value pairs. You can use it in a <span><code>for</code></span> loop like this:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; for key, value in d.items():
...     print(key, value)
...
c 2
a 0
b 1</code></pre>
<p>As you should expect from a dictionary, the items are in no particular order.</p>
<p>Going in the other direction, you can use a list of tuples to initialize a new dictionary:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; t = [(&#39;a&#39;, 0), (&#39;c&#39;, 2), (&#39;b&#39;, 1)]
&gt;&gt;&gt; d = dict(t)
&gt;&gt;&gt; d
{&#39;a&#39;: 0, &#39;c&#39;: 2, &#39;b&#39;: 1}</code></pre>
<p>Combining <span><code>dict</code></span> with <span><code>zip</code></span> yields a concise way to create a dictionary:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; d = dict(zip(&#39;abc&#39;, range(3)))
&gt;&gt;&gt; d
{&#39;a&#39;: 0, &#39;c&#39;: 2, &#39;b&#39;: 1}</code></pre>
<p>The dictionary method <span><code>update</code></span> also takes a list of tuples and adds them, as key-value pairs, to an existing dictionary.</p>
<p>It is common to use tuples as keys in dictionaries (primarily because you can’t use lists). For example, a telephone directory might map from last-name, first-name pairs to telephone numbers. Assuming that we have defined <span><code>last</code></span>, <span><code>first</code></span> and <span><code>number</code></span>, we could write:</p>
<pre><code>directory[last, first] = number</code></pre>
<p>The expression in brackets is a tuple. We could use tuple assignment to traverse this dictionary.</p>
<pre><code>for last, first in directory:
    print(first, last, directory[last,first])</code></pre>
<p>This loop traverses the keys in <span><code>directory</code></span>, which are tuples. It assigns the elements of each tuple to <span><code>last</code></span> and <span><code>first</code></span>, then prints the name and corresponding telephone number.</p>
<p>There are two ways to represent tuples in a state diagram. The more detailed version shows the indices and elements just as they appear in a list. For example, the tuple <code>('Cleese', 'John')</code> would appear as in Figure <a href="#fig.tuple1" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig.tuple1">13.1</a>.</p>
<figure>
<embed src="figs/tuple1.pdf" id="fig.tuple1" /><figcaption>State diagram.<span label="fig.tuple1"></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>But in a larger diagram you might want to leave out the details. For example, a diagram of the telephone directory might appear as in Figure <a href="#fig.dict2" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig.dict2">13.2</a>.</p>
<figure>
<embed src="figs/dict2.pdf" id="fig.dict2" /><figcaption>State diagram.<span label="fig.dict2"></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Here the tuples are shown using Python syntax as a graphical shorthand. The telephone number in the diagram is the complaints line for the BBC, so please don’t call it.</p>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>Sequences of sequences</span></p>
<p>I have focused on lists of tuples, but almost all of the examples in this chapter also work with lists of lists, tuples of tuples, and tuples of lists. To avoid enumerating the possible combinations, it is sometimes easier to talk about sequences of sequences.</p>
<p>In many contexts, the different kinds of sequences (strings, lists and tuples) can be used interchangeably. So how should you choose one over the others?</p>
<p>To start with the obvious, strings are more limited than other sequences because the elements have to be characters. They are also immutable. If you need the ability to change the characters in a string (as opposed to creating a new string), you might want to use a list of characters instead.</p>
<p>Lists are more common than tuples, mostly because they are mutable. But there are a few cases where you might prefer tuples:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>In some contexts, like a <span><code>return</code></span> statement, it is syntactically simpler to create a tuple than a list.</p></li>
<li><p>If you want to use a sequence as a dictionary key, you have to use an immutable type like a tuple or string.</p></li>
<li><p>If you are passing a sequence as an argument to a function, using tuples reduces the potential for unexpected behavior due to aliasing.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Because tuples are immutable, they don’t provide methods like <span><code> sort</code></span> and <span><code>reverse</code></span>, which modify existing lists. But Python provides the built-in function <span><code>sorted</code></span>, which takes any sequence and returns a new list with the same elements in sorted order, and <span><code>reversed</code></span>, which takes a sequence and returns an iterator that traverses the list in reverse order.</p>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>Debugging</span></p>
<p>Lists, dictionaries and tuples are examples of <span><strong>data structures</strong></span>; in this chapter we are starting to see compound data structures, like lists of tuples, or dictionaries that contain tuples as keys and lists as values. Compound data structures are useful, but they are prone to what I call <span><strong>shape errors</strong></span>; that is, errors caused when a data structure has the wrong type, size, or structure. For example, if you are expecting a list with one integer and I give you a plain old integer (not in a list), it won’t work.</p>
<p>To help debug these kinds of errors, I have written a module called <span><code>structshape</code></span> that provides a function, also called <span><code>structshape</code></span>, that takes any kind of data structure as an argument and returns a string that summarizes its shape. You can download it from <a href="http://thinkpython2.com/code/structshape.py">http://thinkpython2.com/code/structshape.py</a></p>
<p>Here’s the result for a simple list:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; from structshape import structshape
&gt;&gt;&gt; t = [1, 2, 3]
&gt;&gt;&gt; structshape(t)
&#39;list of 3 int&#39;</code></pre>
<p>A fancier program might write “list of 3 int<span><em>s</em></span>”, but it was easier not to deal with plurals. Here’s a list of lists:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Write a program that reads a word list from a file (see Section <a href="#wordlist" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="wordlist">[wordlist]</a>) and prints all the sets of words that are anagrams.</p>
<p>Here is an example of what the output might look like:</p>
<pre><code>[&#39;deltas&#39;, &#39;desalt&#39;, &#39;lasted&#39;, &#39;salted&#39;, &#39;slated&#39;, &#39;staled&#39;]

<p>Two words form a “metathesis pair” if you can transform one into the other by swapping two letters; for example, “converse” and “conserve”. Write a program that finds all of the metathesis pairs in the dictionary. Hint: don’t test all pairs of words, and don’t test all possible swaps. Solution: <a href="http://thinkpython2.com/code/metathesis.py">http://thinkpython2.com/code/metathesis.py</a>. Credit: This exercise is inspired by an example at <a href="http://puzzlers.org">http://puzzlers.org</a>.</p>
<p>Here’s another Car Talk Puzzler (<a href="http://www.cartalk.com/content/puzzlers">http://www.cartalk.com/content/puzzlers</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is the longest English word, that remains a valid English word, as you remove its letters one at a time?</p>
<p>Now, letters can be removed from either end, or the middle, but you can’t rearrange any of the letters. Every time you drop a letter, you wind up with another English word. If you do that, you’re eventually going to wind up with one letter and that too is going to be an English word—one that’s found in the dictionary. I want to know what’s the longest word and how many letters does it have?</p>
<p>I’m going to give you a little modest example: Sprite. Ok? You start off with sprite, you take a letter off, one from the interior of the word, take the r away, and we’re left with the word spite, then we take the e off the end, we’re left with spit, we take the s off, we’re left with pit, it, and I.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Write a program to find all words that can be reduced in this way, and then find the longest one.</p>
<p>This exercise is a little more challenging than most, so here are some suggestions:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>You might want to write a function that takes a word and computes a list of all the words that can be formed by removing one letter. These are the “children” of the word.</p></li>
<li><p>Recursively, a word is reducible if any of its children are reducible. As a base case, you can consider the empty string reducible.</p></li>
<li><p>The wordlist I provided, <span><code>words.txt</code></span>, doesn’t contain single letter words. So you might want to add “I”, “a”, and the empty string.</p></li>
<li><p>To improve the performance of your program, you might want to memoize the words that are known to be reducible.</p></li>

<h1 id="case-study-data-structure-selection">Case study: data structure selection</h1>
<p>At this point you have learned about Python’s core data structures, and you have seen some of the algorithms that use them. If you would like to know more about algorithms, this might be a good time to read Chapter <a href="#algorithms" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="algorithms">22</a>. But you don’t have to read it before you go on; you can read it whenever you are interested.</p>
<p>This chapter presents a case study with exercises that let you think about choosing data structures and practice using them.</p>

<p>As usual, you should at least attempt the exercises before you read my solutions.</p>
<p>Write a program that reads a file, breaks each line into words, strips whitespace and punctuation from the words, and converts them to lowercase.</p>
<p>Hint: The <span><code>string</code></span> module provides a string named <span><code>whitespace</code></span>, which contains space, tab, newline, etc., and <span><code> punctuation</code></span> which contains the punctuation characters. Let’s see if we can make Python swear:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import string
&gt;&gt;&gt; string.punctuation
&#39;!&quot;#$%&amp;\&#39;()*+,-./:;&lt;=&gt;?@[\\]^_`{|}~&#39;</code></pre>
<p>Also, you might consider using the string methods <span><code>strip</code></span>, <span><code>replace</code></span> and <span><code>translate</code></span>.</p>
<p>Go to Project Gutenberg (<a href="http://gutenberg.org">http://gutenberg.org</a>) and download your favorite out-of-copyright book in plain text format.</p>
<p>Modify your program from the previous exercise to read the book you downloaded, skip over the header information at the beginning of the file, and process the rest of the words as before.</p>
<p>Then modify the program to count the total number of words in the book, and the number of times each word is used.</p>
<p>Print the number of different words used in the book. Compare different books by different authors, written in different eras. Which author uses the most extensive vocabulary?</p>
<p>Modify the program from the previous exercise to print the 20 most frequently used words in the book.</p>
<p>Modify the previous program to read a word list (see Section <a href="#wordlist" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="wordlist">[wordlist]</a>) and then print all the words in the book that are not in the word list. How many of them are typos? How many of them are common words that <span><em>should</em></span> be in the word list, and how many of them are really obscure?</p>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>Random numbers</span></p>
<p>Given the same inputs, most computer programs generate the same outputs every time, so they are said to be <span><strong>deterministic</strong></span>. Determinism is usually a good thing, since we expect the same calculation to yield the same result. For some applications, though, we want the computer to be unpredictable. Games are an obvious example, but there are more.</p>
<p>Making a program truly nondeterministic turns out to be difficult, but there are ways to make it at least seem nondeterministic. One of them is to use algorithms that generate <span><strong>pseudorandom</strong></span> numbers. Pseudorandom numbers are not truly random because they are generated by a deterministic computation, but just by looking at the numbers it is all but impossible to distinguish them from random.</p>
<p>The <span><code>random</code></span> module provides functions that generate pseudorandom numbers (which I will simply call “random” from here on).</p>
<p>The function <span><code>random</code></span> returns a random float between 0.0 and 1.0 (including 0.0 but not 1.0). Each time you call <span><code>random</code></span>, you get the next number in a long series. To see a sample, run this loop:</p>
<pre><code>import random

for i in range(10):
    x = random.random()
    print(x)</code></pre>
<p>The function <span><code>randint</code></span> takes parameters <span><code>low</code></span> and <span><code>high</code></span> and returns an integer between <span><code>low</code></span> and <span><code>high</code></span> (including both).</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; random.randint(5, 10)
5
&gt;&gt;&gt; random.randint(5, 10)
9</code></pre>
<p>To choose an element from a sequence at random, you can use <span><code>choice</code></span>:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; t = [1, 2, 3]
&gt;&gt;&gt; random.choice(t)
2
&gt;&gt;&gt; random.choice(t)
3</code></pre>
<p>The <span><code>random</code></span> module also provides functions to generate random values from continuous distributions including Gaussian, exponential, gamma, and a few more.</p>
<p>Write a function named <code>choose_from_hist</code> that takes a histogram as defined in Section <a href="#histogram" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="histogram">[histogram]</a> and returns a random value from the histogram, chosen with probability in proportion to frequency. For example, for this histogram:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; t = [&#39;a&#39;, &#39;a&#39;, &#39;b&#39;]
&gt;&gt;&gt; hist = histogram(t)
&gt;&gt;&gt; hist
{&#39;a&#39;: 2, &#39;b&#39;: 1}</code></pre>
<p>your function should return <code>'a'</code> with probability <span class="math inline">2/3</span> and <code>'b'</code> with probability <span class="math inline">1/3</span>.</p>

<p>You should attempt the previous exercises before you go on. You can download my solution from <a href="http://thinkpython2.com/code/analyze_book1.py">http://thinkpython2.com/code/analyze_book1.py</a>. You will also need <a href="http://thinkpython2.com/code/emma.txt">http://thinkpython2.com/code/emma.txt</a>.</p>
<p>Here is a program that reads a file and builds a histogram of the words in the file:</p>
<pre><code>import string

def process_file(filename):
    hist = dict()
    fp = open(filename)
    for line in fp:
        process_line(line, hist)
    return hist

def process_line(line, hist):
    line = line.replace(&#39;-&#39;, &#39; &#39;)
    
    for word in line.split():
        word = word.strip(string.punctuation + string.whitespace)
        word = word.lower()
        hist[word] = hist.get(word, 0) + 1

hist = process_file(&#39;emma.txt&#39;)</code></pre>
<p>This program reads <span><code>emma.txt</code></span>, which contains the text of <span> <em>Emma</em></span> by Jane Austen.</p>
<p><code>process_file</code> loops through the lines of the file, passing them one at a time to <code>process_line</code>. The histogram <span><code>hist</code></span> is being used as an accumulator.</p>
<p><code>process_line</code> uses the string method <span><code>replace</code></span> to replace hyphens with spaces before using <span><code>split</code></span> to break the line into a list of strings. It traverses the list of words and uses <span><code>strip</code></span> and <span><code>lower</code></span> to remove punctuation and convert to lower case. (It is a shorthand to say that strings are “converted”; remember that strings are immutable, so methods like <span><code>strip</code></span> and <span><code>lower</code></span> return new strings.)</p>
<p>Finally, <code>process_line</code> updates the histogram by creating a new item or incrementing an existing one.</p>
<p>To count the total number of words in the file, we can add up the frequencies in the histogram:</p>
<pre><code>def total_words(hist):
    return sum(hist.values())</code></pre>
<p>The number of different words is just the number of items in the dictionary:</p>
<pre><code>def different_words(hist):
    return len(hist)</code></pre>
<p>Here is some code to print the results:</p>
<pre><code>print(&#39;Total number of words:&#39;, total_words(hist))
print(&#39;Number of different words:&#39;, different_words(hist))</code></pre>
<p>And the results:</p>
<pre><code>Total number of words: 161080
Number of different words: 7214</code></pre>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>Most common words</span></p>
<p>To find the most common words, we can make a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a word and its frequency, and sort it.</p>
<p>The following function takes a histogram and returns a list of word-frequency tuples:</p>
<pre><code>def most_common(hist):
    t = []
    for key, value in hist.items():
        t.append((value, key))

    t.sort(reverse=True)
    return t</code></pre>
<p>In each tuple, the frequency appears first, so the resulting list is sorted by frequency. Here is a loop that prints the ten most common words:</p>
<pre><code>t = most_common(hist)
print(&#39;The most common words are:&#39;)
for freq, word in t[:10]:
    print(word, freq, sep=&#39;\t&#39;)</code></pre>
<p>I use the keyword argument <span><code>sep</code></span> to tell <span><code>print</code></span> to use a tab character as a “separator”, rather than a space, so the second column is lined up. Here are the results from <span><em>Emma</em></span>:</p>
<pre><code>The most common words are:
to      5242
the     5205
and     4897
of      4295
i       3191
a       3130
it      2529
her     2483
was     2400
she     2364</code></pre>
<p>This code can be simplified using the <span><code>key</code></span> parameter of the <span><code>sort</code></span> function. If you are curious, you can read about it at <a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/HowTo/Sorting">https://wiki.python.org/moin/HowTo/Sorting</a>.</p>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>Optional parameters</span></p>
<p>We have seen built-in functions and methods that take optional arguments. It is possible to write programmer-defined functions with optional arguments, too. For example, here is a function that prints the most common words in a histogram</p>
<pre><code>def print_most_common(hist, num=10):
    t = most_common(hist)
    print(&#39;The most common words are:&#39;)
    for freq, word in t[:num]:
        print(word, freq, sep=&#39;\t&#39;)</code></pre>
<p>The first parameter is required; the second is optional. The <span><strong>default value</strong></span> of <span><code>num</code></span> is 10.</p>
<p>If you only provide one argument:</p>
<pre><code>print_most_common(hist)</code></pre>
<p><span><code>num</code></span> gets the default value. If you provide two arguments:</p>
<pre><code>print_most_common(hist, 20)</code></pre>
<p><span><code>num</code></span> gets the value of the argument instead. In other words, the optional argument <span><strong>overrides</strong></span> the default value.</p>
<p>If a function has both required and optional parameters, all the required parameters have to come first, followed by the optional ones.</p>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>Dictionary subtraction</span> <span id="dictsub" label="dictsub">[dictsub]</span></p>
<p>Finding the words from the book that are not in the word list from <span><code>words.txt</code></span> is a problem you might recognize as set subtraction; that is, we want to find all the words from one set (the words in the book) that are not in the other (the words in the list).</p>
<p><span><code>subtract</code></span> takes dictionaries <span><code>d1</code></span> and <span><code>d2</code></span> and returns a new dictionary that contains all the keys from <span><code>d1</code></span> that are not in <span><code>d2</code></span>. Since we don’t really care about the values, we set them all to None.</p>
<pre><code>def subtract(d1, d2):
    res = dict()
    for key in d1:
        if key not in d2:
            res[key] = None
    return res</code></pre>
<p>To find the words in the book that are not in <span><code>words.txt</code></span>, we can use <code>process_file</code> to build a histogram for <span><code>words.txt</code></span>, and then subtract:</p>
<pre><code>words = process_file(&#39;words.txt&#39;)
diff = subtract(hist, words)

print(&quot;Words in the book that aren&#39;t in the word list:&quot;)
for word in diff:
    print(word, end=&#39; &#39;)</code></pre>
<p>Here are some of the results from <span><em>Emma</em></span>:</p>
<pre><code>Words in the book that aren&#39;t in the word list:
rencontre jane&#39;s blanche woodhouses disingenuousness 
friend&#39;s venice apartment ...</code></pre>
<p>Some of these words are names and possessives. Others, like “rencontre”, are no longer in common use. But a few are common words that should really be in the list!</p>
<p>Python provides a data structure called <span><code>set</code></span> that provides many common set operations. You can read about them in Section <a href="#sets" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sets">[sets]</a>, or read the documentation at <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#types-set">http://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#types-set</a>.</p>
<p>Write a program that uses set subtraction to find words in the book that are not in the word list. Solution: <a href="http://thinkpython2.com/code/analyze_book2.py">http://thinkpython2.com/code/analyze_book2.py</a>.</p>

<p>To choose a random word from the histogram, the simplest algorithm is to build a list with multiple copies of each word, according to the observed frequency, and then choose from the list:</p>
<pre><code>def random_word(h):
    t = []
    for word, freq in h.items():
        t.extend([word] * freq)

    return random.choice(t)</code></pre>
<p>The expression <span><code>[word] * freq</code></span> creates a list with <span><code>freq</code></span> copies of the string <span><code>word</code></span>. The <span><code>extend</code></span> method is similar to <span><code>append</code></span> except that the argument is a sequence.</p>
<p>This algorithm works, but it is not very efficient; each time you choose a random word, it rebuilds the list, which is as big as the original book. An obvious improvement is to build the list once and then make multiple selections, but the list is still big.</p>
<p>An alternative is:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Use <span><code>keys</code></span> to get a list of the words in the book.</p></li>
<li><p>Build a list that contains the cumulative sum of the word frequencies (see Exercise <a href="#cumulative" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="cumulative">[cumulative]</a>). The last item in this list is the total number of words in the book, <span class="math inline"><em>n</em></span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Choose a random number from 1 to <span class="math inline"><em>n</em></span>. Use a bisection search (See Exercise <a href="#bisection" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="bisection">[bisection]</a>) to find the index where the random number would be inserted in the cumulative sum.</p></li>
<li><p>Use the index to find the corresponding word in the word list.</p></li>

<p>If you choose words from the book at random, you can get a sense of the vocabulary, but you probably won’t get a sentence:</p>
<pre><code>this the small regard harriet which knightley&#39;s it most things</code></pre>
<p>A series of random words seldom makes sense because there is no relationship between successive words. For example, in a real sentence you would expect an article like “the” to be followed by an adjective or a noun, and probably not a verb or adverb.</p>
<p>One way to measure these kinds of relationships is Markov analysis, which characterizes, for a given sequence of words, the probability of the words that might come next. For example, the song <span><em>Eric, the Half a Bee</em></span> begins:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Half a bee, philosophically,<br />
Must, ipso facto, half not be.<br />
But half the bee has got to be<br />
Vis a vis, its entity. D’you see?<br />
<br />
But can a bee be said to be<br />
Or not to be an entire bee<br />
When half the bee is not a bee<br />
Due to some ancient injury?<br />
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this text, the phrase “half the” is always followed by the word “bee”, but the phrase “the bee” might be followed by either “has” or “is”.</p>
<p>The result of Markov analysis is a mapping from each prefix (like “half the” and “the bee”) to all possible suffixes (like “has” and “is”).</p>
<p>Given this mapping, you can generate a random text by starting with any prefix and choosing at random from the possible suffixes. Next, you can combine the end of the prefix and the new suffix to form the next prefix, and repeat.</p>
<p>For example, if you start with the prefix “Half a”, then the next word has to be “bee”, because the prefix only appears once in the text. The next prefix is “a bee”, so the next suffix might be “philosophically”, “be” or “due”.</p>
<p>In this example the length of the prefix is always two, but you can do Markov analysis with any prefix length.</p>
<p>Markov analysis:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Write a program to read a text from a file and perform Markov analysis. The result should be a dictionary that maps from prefixes to a collection of possible suffixes. The collection might be a list, tuple, or dictionary; it is up to you to make an appropriate choice. You can test your program with prefix length two, but you should write the program in a way that makes it easy to try other lengths.</p></li>
<li><p>Add a function to the previous program to generate random text based on the Markov analysis. Here is an example from <span><em>Emma</em></span> with prefix length 2:</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Using Markov analysis to generate random text is fun, but there is also a point to this exercise: data structure selection. In your solution to the previous exercises, you had to choose:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>How to represent the prefixes.</p></li>
<li><p>How to represent the collection of possible suffixes.</p></li>
<li><p>How to represent the mapping from each prefix to the collection of possible suffixes.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The last one is easy: a dictionary is the obvious choice for a mapping from keys to corresponding values.</p>
<p>For the prefixes, the most obvious options are string, list of strings, or tuple of strings.</p>
<p>For the suffixes, one option is a list; another is a histogram (dictionary).</p>
<p>How should you choose? The first step is to think about the operations you will need to implement for each data structure. For the prefixes, we need to be able to remove words from the beginning and add to the end. For example, if the current prefix is “Half a”, and the next word is “bee”, you need to be able to form the next prefix, “a bee”.</p>
<p>Your first choice might be a list, since it is easy to add and remove elements, but we also need to be able to use the prefixes as keys in a dictionary, so that rules out lists. With tuples, you can’t append or remove, but you can use the addition operator to form a new tuple:</p>
<pre><code>def shift(prefix, word):
    return prefix[1:] + (word,)</code></pre>
<p><span><code>shift</code></span> takes a tuple of words, <span><code>prefix</code></span>, and a string, <span><code>word</code></span>, and forms a new tuple that has all the words in <span><code>prefix</code></span> except the first, and <span><code>word</code></span> added to the end.</p>
<p>For the collection of suffixes, the operations we need to perform include adding a new suffix (or increasing the frequency of an existing one), and choosing a random suffix.</p>
<p>Adding a new suffix is equally easy for the list implementation or the histogram. Choosing a random element from a list is easy; choosing from a histogram is harder to do efficiently (see Exercise <a href="#randhist" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="randhist">[randhist]</a>).</p>
<p>So far we have been talking mostly about ease of implementation, but there are other factors to consider in choosing data structures. One is run time. Sometimes there is a theoretical reason to expect one data structure to be faster than other; for example, I mentioned that the <span><code>in</code></span> operator is faster for dictionaries than for lists, at least when the number of elements is large.</p>
<p>But often you don’t know ahead of time which implementation will be faster. One option is to implement both of them and see which is better. This approach is called <span><strong>benchmarking</strong></span>. A practical alternative is to choose the data structure that is easiest to implement, and then see if it is fast enough for the intended application. If so, there is no need to go on. If not, there are tools, like the <span><code>profile</code></span> module, that can identify the places in a program that take the most time.</p>
<p>The other factor to consider is storage space. For example, using a histogram for the collection of suffixes might take less space because you only have to store each word once, no matter how many times it appears in the text. In some cases, saving space can also make your program run faster, and in the extreme, your program might not run at all if you run out of memory. But for many applications, space is a secondary consideration after run time.</p>
<p>One final thought: in this discussion, I have implied that we should use one data structure for both analysis and generation. But since these are separate phases, it would also be possible to use one structure for analysis and then convert to another structure for generation. This would be a net win if the time saved during generation exceeded the time spent in conversion.</p>

<p>When you are debugging a program, and especially if you are working on a hard bug, there are five things to try:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Reading:</dt>
<dd><p>Examine your code, read it back to yourself, and check that it says what you meant to say.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Running:</dt>
<dd><p>Experiment by making changes and running different versions. Often if you display the right thing at the right place in the program, the problem becomes obvious, but sometimes you have to build scaffolding.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Ruminating:</dt>
<dd><p>Take some time to think! What kind of error is it: syntax, runtime, or semantic? What information can you get from the error messages, or from the output of the program? What kind of error could cause the problem you’re seeing? What did you change last, before the problem appeared?</p>
</dd>
<dt>Rubberducking:</dt>
<dd><p>If you explain the problem to someone else, you sometimes find the answer before you finish asking the question. Often you don’t need the other person; you could just talk to a rubber duck. And that’s the origin of the well-known strategy called <span> <strong>rubber duck debugging</strong></span>. I am not making this up; see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging</a>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Retreating:</dt>
<dd><p>At some point, the best thing to do is back off, undoing recent changes, until you get back to a program that works and that you understand. Then you can start rebuilding.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Beginning programmers sometimes get stuck on one of these activities and forget the others. Each activity comes with its own failure mode.</p>
<p>For example, reading your code might help if the problem is a typographical error, but not if the problem is a conceptual misunderstanding. If you don’t understand what your program does, you can read it 100 times and never see the error, because the error is in your head.</p>
<p>Running experiments can help, especially if you run small, simple tests. But if you run experiments without thinking or reading your code, you might fall into a pattern I call “random walk programming”, which is the process of making random changes until the program does the right thing. Needless to say, random walk programming can take a long time.</p>
<p>You have to take time to think. Debugging is like an experimental science. You should have at least one hypothesis about what the problem is. If there are two or more possibilities, try to think of a test that would eliminate one of them.</p>
<p>But even the best debugging techniques will fail if there are too many errors, or if the code you are trying to fix is too big and complicated. Sometimes the best option is to retreat, simplifying the program until you get to something that works and that you understand.</p>
<p>Beginning programmers are often reluctant to retreat because they can’t stand to delete a line of code (even if it’s wrong). If it makes you feel better, copy your program into another file before you start stripping it down. Then you can copy the pieces back one at a time.</p>
<p>Finding a hard bug requires reading, running, ruminating, and sometimes retreating. If you get stuck on one of these activities, try the others.</p>

<p>The “rank” of a word is its position in a list of words sorted by frequency: the most common word has rank 1, the second most common has rank 2, etc.</p>
<p>Zipf’s law describes a relationship between the ranks and frequencies of words in natural languages (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipf&#39;s_law">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipf's_law</a>). Specifically, it predicts that the frequency, <span class="math inline"><em>f</em></span>, of the word with rank <span class="math inline"><em>r</em></span> is:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math display"><em>f</em> = <em>c</em><em>r</em><sup> − <em>s</em></sup></span><br /> where <span class="math inline"><em>s</em></span> and <span class="math inline"><em>c</em></span> are parameters that depend on the language and the text. If you take the logarithm of both sides of this equation, you get:</p>
<p><br /><span class="math display">log <em>f</em> = log <em>c</em> − <em>s</em>log <em>r</em></span><br /> So if you plot log <span class="math inline"><em>f</em></span> versus log <span class="math inline"><em>r</em></span>, you should get a straight line with slope <span class="math inline"> − <em>s</em></span> and intercept log <span class="math inline"><em>c</em></span>.</p>
<p>Write a program that reads a text from a file, counts word frequencies, and prints one line for each word, in descending order of frequency, with log <span class="math inline"><em>f</em></span> and log <span class="math inline"><em>r</em></span>. Use the graphing program of your choice to plot the results and check whether they form a straight line. Can you estimate the value of <span class="math inline"><em>s</em></span>?</p>
<p>Solution: <a href="http://thinkpython2.com/code/zipf.py">http://thinkpython2.com/code/zipf.py</a>. To run my solution, you need the plotting module <span><code>matplotlib</code></span>. If you installed Anaconda, you already have <span><code>matplotlib</code></span>; otherwise you might have to install it.</p>
<h1 id="files">Files</h1>
<p>This chapter introduces the idea of “persistent” programs that keep data in permanent storage, and shows how to use different kinds of permanent storage, like files and databases.</p>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>Persistence</span></p>
<p>Most of the programs we have seen so far are transient in the sense that they run for a short time and produce some output, but when they end, their data disappears. If you run the program again, it starts with a clean slate.</p>
<p>Other programs are <span><strong>persistent</strong></span>: they run for a long time (or all the time); they keep at least some of their data in permanent storage (a hard drive, for example); and if they shut down and restart, they pick up where they left off.</p>
<p>Examples of persistent programs are operating systems, which run pretty much whenever a computer is on, and web servers, which run all the time, waiting for requests to come in on the network.</p>
<p>One of the simplest ways for programs to maintain their data is by reading and writing text files. We have already seen programs that read text files; in this chapter we will see programs that write them.</p>
<p>An alternative is to store the state of the program in a database. In this chapter I will present a simple database and a module, <span><code>pickle</code></span>, that makes it easy to store program data.</p>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>Reading and writing</span></p>
<p>A text file is a sequence of characters stored on a permanent medium like a hard drive, flash memory, or CD-ROM. We saw how to open and read a file in Section <a href="#wordlist" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="wordlist">[wordlist]</a>.</p>
<p>To write a file, you have to open it with mode <code>'w'</code> as a second parameter:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; fout = open(&#39;output.txt&#39;, &#39;w&#39;)</code></pre>
<p>If the file already exists, opening it in write mode clears out the old data and starts fresh, so be careful! If the file doesn’t exist, a new one is created.</p>
<p><span><code>open</code></span> returns a file object that provides methods for working with the file. The <span><code>write</code></span> method puts data into the file.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; line1 = &quot;This here&#39;s the wattle,\n&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt; fout.write(line1)
24</code></pre>
<p>The return value is the number of characters that were written. The file object keeps track of where it is, so if you call <span><code>write</code></span> again, it adds the new data to the end of the file.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; line2 = &quot;the emblem of our land.\n&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt; fout.write(line2)
24</code></pre>
<p>When you are done writing, you should close the file.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; fout.close()</code></pre>
<p>If you don’t close the file, it gets closed for you when the program ends.</p>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>Format operator</span></p>
<p>The argument of <span><code>write</code></span> has to be a string, so if we want to put other values in a file, we have to convert them to strings. The easiest way to do that is with <span><code>str</code></span>:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; x = 52
&gt;&gt;&gt; fout.write(str(x))</code></pre>
<p>An alternative is to use the <span><strong>format operator</strong></span>, <span><code>%</code></span>. When applied to integers, <span><code>%</code></span> is the modulus operator. But when the first operand is a string, <span><code>%</code></span> is the format operator.</p>
<p>The first operand is the <span><strong>format string</strong></span>, which contains one or more <span><strong>format sequences</strong></span>, which specify how the second operand is formatted. The result is a string.</p>
<p>For example, the format sequence <code>'%d'</code> means that the second operand should be formatted as a decimal integer:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; camels = 42
&gt;&gt;&gt; &#39;%d&#39; % camels
&#39;42&#39;</code></pre>
<p>The result is the string <code>'42'</code>, which is not to be confused with the integer value <span><code>42</code></span>.</p>
<p>A format sequence can appear anywhere in the string, so you can embed a value in a sentence:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; &#39;I have spotted %d camels.&#39; % camels
&#39;I have spotted 42 camels.&#39;</code></pre>
<p>If there is more than one format sequence in the string, the second argument has to be a tuple. Each format sequence is matched with an element of the tuple, in order.</p>
<p>The following example uses <code>'%d'</code> to format an integer, <code>'%g'</code> to format a floating-point number, and <code>'%s'</code> to format a string:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; &#39;In %d years I have spotted %g %s.&#39; % (3, 0.1, &#39;camels&#39;)
&#39;In 3 years I have spotted 0.1 camels.&#39;</code></pre>
<p>The number of elements in the tuple has to match the number of format sequences in the string. Also, the types of the elements have to match the format sequences:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; &#39;%d %d %d&#39; % (1, 2)
TypeError: not enough arguments for format string
&gt;&gt;&gt; &#39;%d&#39; % &#39;dollars&#39;
TypeError: %d format: a number is required, not str</code></pre>
<p>In the first example, there aren’t enough elements; in the second, the element is the wrong type.</p>
<p>For more information on the format operator, see <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#printf-style-string-formatting">https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#printf-style-string-formatting</a>. A more powerful alternative is the string format method, which you can read about at <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.format">https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.format</a>.</p>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>Filenames and paths</span> <span id="paths" label="paths">[paths]</span></p>
<p>Files are organized into <span><strong>directories</strong></span> (also called “folders”). Every running program has a “current directory”, which is the default directory for most operations. For example, when you open a file for reading, Python looks for it in the current directory.</p>
<p>The <span><code>os</code></span> module provides functions for working with files and directories (“os” stands for “operating system”). <span><code>os.getcwd</code></span> returns the name of the current directory:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import os
&gt;&gt;&gt; cwd = os.getcwd()
&gt;&gt;&gt; cwd
&#39;/home/dinsdale&#39;</code></pre>
<p><span><code>cwd</code></span> stands for “current working directory”. The result in this example is <span><code>/home/dinsdale</code></span>, which is the home directory of a user named <span><code>dinsdale</code></span>.</p>
<p>A string like <code>'/home/dinsdale'</code> that identifies a file or directory is called a <span><strong>path</strong></span>.</p>
<p>A simple filename, like <span><code>memo.txt</code></span> is also considered a path, but it is a <span><strong>relative path</strong></span> because it relates to the current directory. If the current directory is <span><code>/home/dinsdale</code></span>, the filename <span><code>memo.txt</code></span> would refer to <span><code>/home/dinsdale/memo.txt</code></span>.</p>
<p>A path that begins with <span><code>/</code></span> does not depend on the current directory; it is called an <span><strong>absolute path</strong></span>. To find the absolute path to a file, you can use <span><code>os.path.abspath</code></span>:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; os.path.abspath(&#39;memo.txt&#39;)
&#39;/home/dinsdale/memo.txt&#39;</code></pre>
<p><span><code>os.path</code></span> provides other functions for working with filenames and paths. For example, <span><code>os.path.exists</code></span> checks whether a file or directory exists:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; os.path.exists(&#39;memo.txt&#39;)
True</code></pre>
<p>If it exists, <span><code>os.path.isdir</code></span> checks whether it’s a directory:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; os.path.isdir(&#39;memo.txt&#39;)
False
&gt;&gt;&gt; os.path.isdir(&#39;/home/dinsdale&#39;)
True</code></pre>
<p>Similarly, <span><code>os.path.isfile</code></span> checks whether it’s a file.</p>
<p><span><code>os.listdir</code></span> returns a list of the files (and other directories) in the given directory:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; os.listdir(cwd)
[&#39;music&#39;, &#39;photos&#39;, &#39;memo.txt&#39;]</code></pre>
<p>To demonstrate these functions, the following example “walks” through a directory, prints the names of all the files, and calls itself recursively on all the directories.</p>
<pre><code>def walk(dirname):
    for name in os.listdir(dirname):
        path = os.path.join(dirname, name)

        if os.path.isfile(path):
            print(path)
        else:
            walk(path)</code></pre>
<p><span><code>os.path.join</code></span> takes a directory and a file name and joins them into a complete path.</p>
<p>The <span><code>os</code></span> module provides a function called <span><code>walk</code></span> that is similar to this one but more versatile. As an exercise, read the documentation and use it to print the names of the files in a given directory and its subdirectories. You can download my solution from <a href="http://thinkpython2.com/code/walk.py">http://thinkpython2.com/code/walk.py</a>.</p>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>Catching exceptions</span> <span id="catch" label="catch">[catch]</span></p>
<p>A lot of things can go wrong when you try to read and write files. If you try to open a file that doesn’t exist, you get an <span><code>IOError</code></span>:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; fin = open(&#39;bad_file&#39;)
IOError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: &#39;bad_file&#39;</code></pre>
<p>If you don’t have permission to access a file:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; fout = open(&#39;/etc/passwd&#39;, &#39;w&#39;)
PermissionError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: &#39;/etc/passwd&#39;</code></pre>
<p>And if you try to open a directory for reading, you get</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; fin = open(&#39;/home&#39;)
IsADirectoryError: [Errno 21] Is a directory: &#39;/home&#39;</code></pre>
<p>To avoid these errors, you could use functions like <span><code>os.path.exists</code></span> and <span><code>os.path.isfile</code></span>, but it would take a lot of time and code to check all the possibilities (if “<span><code>Errno 21</code></span>” is any indication, there are at least 21 things that can go wrong).</p>
<p>It is better to go ahead and try—and deal with problems if they happen—which is exactly what the <span><code>try</code></span> statement does. The syntax is similar to an <span><code>if...else</code></span> statement:</p>
<pre><code>try:    
    fin = open(&#39;bad_file&#39;)
except:
    print(&#39;Something went wrong.&#39;)</code></pre>
<p>Python starts by executing the <span><code>try</code></span> clause. If all goes well, it skips the <span><code>except</code></span> clause and proceeds. If an exception occurs, it jumps out of the <span><code>try</code></span> clause and runs the <span><code>except</code></span> clause.</p>
<p>Handling an exception with a <span><code>try</code></span> statement is called <span> <strong>catching</strong></span> an exception. In this example, the <span><code>except</code></span> clause prints an error message that is not very helpful. In general, catching an exception gives you a chance to fix the problem, or try again, or at least end the program gracefully.</p>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>Databases</span></p>
<p>A <span><strong>database</strong></span> is a file that is organized for storing data. Many databases are organized like a dictionary in the sense that they map from keys to values. The biggest difference between a database and a dictionary is that the database is on disk (or other permanent storage), so it persists after the program ends.</p>
<p>The module <span><code>dbm</code></span> provides an interface for creating and updating database files. As an example, I’ll create a database that contains captions for image files.</p>
<p>Opening a database is similar to opening other files:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import dbm
&gt;&gt;&gt; db = dbm.open(&#39;captions&#39;, &#39;c&#39;)</code></pre>
<p>The mode <code>'c'</code> means that the database should be created if it doesn’t already exist. The result is a database object that can be used (for most operations) like a dictionary.</p>
<p>When you create a new item, <span><code>dbm</code></span> updates the database file.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; db[&#39;cleese.png&#39;] = &#39;Photo of John Cleese.&#39;</code></pre>
<p>When you access one of the items, <span><code>dbm</code></span> reads the file:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; db[&#39;cleese.png&#39;]
b&#39;Photo of John Cleese.&#39;</code></pre>
<p>The result is a <span><strong>bytes object</strong></span>, which is why it begins with <span><code> b</code></span>. A bytes object is similar to a string in many ways. When you get farther into Python, the difference becomes important, but for now we can ignore it.</p>
<p>If you make another assignment to an existing key, <span><code>dbm</code></span> replaces the old value:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; db[&#39;cleese.png&#39;] = &#39;Photo of John Cleese doing a silly walk.&#39;
&gt;&gt;&gt; db[&#39;cleese.png&#39;]
b&#39;Photo of John Cleese doing a silly walk.&#39;</code></pre>
<p>Some dictionary methods, like <span><code>keys</code></span> and <span><code>items</code></span>, don’t work with database objects. But iteration with a <span><code>for</code></span> loop works:</p>
<pre><code>for key in db:
    print(key, db[key])</code></pre>
<p>As with other files, you should close the database when you are done:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; db.close()</code></pre>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>Pickling</span></p>
<p>A limitation of <span><code>dbm</code></span> is that the keys and values have to be strings or bytes. If you try to use any other type, you get an error.</p>
<p>The <span><code>pickle</code></span> module can help. It translates almost any type of object into a string suitable for storage in a database, and then translates strings back into objects.</p>
<p><span><code>pickle.dumps</code></span> takes an object as a parameter and returns a string representation (<span><code>dumps</code></span> is short for “dump string”):</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import pickle
&gt;&gt;&gt; t = [1, 2, 3]
&gt;&gt;&gt; pickle.dumps(t)
b&#39;\x80\x03]q\x00(K\x01K\x02K\x03e.&#39;</code></pre>
<p>The format isn’t obvious to human readers; it is meant to be easy for <span><code>pickle</code></span> to interpret. <span><code>pickle.loads</code></span> (“load string”) reconstitutes the object:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; t1 = [1, 2, 3]
&gt;&gt;&gt; s = pickle.dumps(t1)
&gt;&gt;&gt; t2 = pickle.loads(s)
&gt;&gt;&gt; t2
[1, 2, 3]</code></pre>
<p>Although the new object has the same value as the old, it is not (in general) the same object:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; t1 == t2
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; t1 is t2
False</code></pre>
<p>In other words, pickling and then unpickling has the same effect as copying the object.</p>
<p>You can use <span><code>pickle</code></span> to store non-strings in a database. In fact, this combination is so common that it has been encapsulated in a module called <span><code>shelve</code></span>.</p>

<p>Most operating systems provide a command-line interface, also known as a <span><strong>shell</strong></span>. Shells usually provide commands to navigate the file system and launch applications. For example, in Unix you can change directories with <span><code>cd</code></span>, display the contents of a directory with <span><code>ls</code></span>, and launch a web browser by typing (for example) <span><code>firefox</code></span>.</p>
<p>Any program that you can launch from the shell can also be launched from Python using a <span><strong>pipe object</strong></span>, which represents a running program.</p>
<p>For example, the Unix command <span><code>ls -l</code></span> normally displays the contents of the current directory in long format. You can launch <span><code>ls</code></span> with <span><code>os.popen</code></span><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; cmd = &#39;ls -l&#39;
&gt;&gt;&gt; fp = os.popen(cmd)</code></pre>
<p>The argument is a string that contains a shell command. The return value is an object that behaves like an open file. You can read the output from the <span><code>ls</code></span> process one line at a time with <span><code>readline</code></span> or get the whole thing at once with <span><code>read</code></span>:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; res = fp.read()</code></pre>
<p>When you are done, you close the pipe like a file:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; stat = fp.close()
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(stat)
None</code></pre>
<p>The return value is the final status of the <span><code>ls</code></span> process; <span><code>None</code></span> means that it ended normally (with no errors).</p>
<p>For example, most Unix systems provide a command called <span><code>md5sum</code></span> that reads the contents of a file and computes a “checksum”. You can read about MD5 at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Md5">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Md5</a>. This command provides an efficient way to check whether two files have the same contents. The probability that different contents yield the same checksum is very small (that is, unlikely to happen before the universe collapses).</p>
<p>You can use a pipe to run <span><code>md5sum</code></span> from Python and get the result:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; filename = &#39;book.tex&#39;
&gt;&gt;&gt; cmd = &#39;md5sum &#39; + filename
&gt;&gt;&gt; fp = os.popen(cmd)
&gt;&gt;&gt; res = fp.read()
&gt;&gt;&gt; stat = fp.close()
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(res)
1e0033f0ed0656636de0d75144ba32e0  book.tex
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(stat)

<p>Any file that contains Python code can be imported as a module. For example, suppose you have a file named <span><code>wc.py</code></span> with the following code:</p>
<pre><code>def linecount(filename):
    count = 0
    for line in open(filename):
        count += 1
    return count

print(linecount(&#39;wc.py&#39;))</code></pre>
<p>If you run this program, it reads itself and prints the number of lines in the file, which is 7. You can also import it like this:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import wc
7</code></pre>
<p>Now you have a module object <span><code>wc</code></span>:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; wc
&lt;module &#39;wc&#39; from &#39;wc.py&#39;&gt;</code></pre>
<p>The module object provides <code>linecount</code>:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; wc.linecount(&#39;wc.py&#39;)
7</code></pre>
<p>So that’s how you write modules in Python.</p>
<p>The only problem with this example is that when you import the module it runs the test code at the bottom. Normally when you import a module, it defines new functions but it doesn’t run them.</p>
<p>Programs that will be imported as modules often use the following idiom:</p>
<pre><code>if __name__ == &#39;__main__&#39;:
    print(linecount(&#39;wc.py&#39;))</code></pre>
<p><code>__name__</code> is a built-in variable that is set when the program starts. If the program is running as a script, <code>__name__</code> has the value <code>'__main__'</code>; in that case, the test code runs. Otherwise, if the module is being imported, the test code is skipped.</p>
<p>As an exercise, type this example into a file named <span><code>wc.py</code></span> and run it as a script. Then run the Python interpreter and <span><code>import wc</code></span>. What is the value of <code>__name__</code> when the module is being imported?</p>
<p>Warning: If you import a module that has already been imported, Python does nothing. It does not re-read the file, even if it has changed.</p>
<p>If you want to reload a module, you can use the built-in function <span><code>reload</code></span>, but it can be tricky, so the safest thing to do is restart the interpreter and then import the module again.</p>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>Debugging</span></p>
<p>When you are reading and writing files, you might run into problems with whitespace. These errors can be hard to debug because spaces, tabs and newlines are normally invisible:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; s = &#39;1 2\t 3\n 4&#39;
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(s)
1 2  3
 4</code></pre>
<p>The built-in function <span><code>repr</code></span> can help. It takes any object as an argument and returns a string representation of the object. For strings, it represents whitespace characters with backslash sequences:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; print(repr(s))
&#39;1 2\t 3\n 4&#39;</code></pre>
<p>This can be helpful for debugging.</p>
<p>One other problem you might run into is that different systems use different characters to indicate the end of a line. Some systems use a newline, represented <code>\n</code>. Others use a return character, represented <code>\r</code>. Some use both. If you move files between different systems, these inconsistencies can cause problems.</p>
<p>For most systems, there are applications to convert from one format to another. You can find them (and read more about this issue) at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newline">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newline</a>. Or, of course, you could write one yourself.</p>

<h1 id="clobjects">Classes and objects</h1>
<p>At this point you know how to use functions to organize code and built-in types to organize data. The next step is to learn “object-oriented programming”, which uses programmer-defined types to organize both code and data. Object-oriented programming is a big topic; it will take a few chapters to get there.</p>
<p>Code examples from this chapter are available from <a href="http://thinkpython2.com/code/Point1.py">http://thinkpython2.com/code/Point1.py</a>; solutions to the exercises are available from <a href="http://thinkpython2.com/code/Point1_soln.py">http://thinkpython2.com/code/Point1_soln.py</a>.</p>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>Programmer-defined types</span> <span id="point" label="point">[point]</span></p>
<p>We have used many of Python’s built-in types; now we are going to define a new type. As an example, we will create a type called <span><code>Point</code></span> that represents a point in two-dimensional space.</p>
<p>In mathematical notation, points are often written in parentheses with a comma separating the coordinates. For example, <span class="math inline">(0, 0)</span> represents the origin, and <span class="math inline">(<em>x</em>, <em>y</em>)</span> represents the point <span class="math inline"><em>x</em></span> units to the right and <span class="math inline"><em>y</em></span> units up from the origin.</p>
<p>There are several ways we might represent points in Python:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>We could store the coordinates separately in two variables, <span><code>x</code></span> and <span><code>y</code></span>.</p></li>
<li><p>We could store the coordinates as elements in a list or tuple.</p></li>
<li><p>We could create a new type to represent points as objects.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Creating a new type is more complicated than the other options, but it has advantages that will be apparent soon.</p>
<p>A programmer-defined type is also called a <span><strong>class</strong></span>. A class definition looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>class Point:
    &quot;&quot;&quot;Represents a point in 2-D space.&quot;&quot;&quot;</code></pre>
<p>The header indicates that the new class is called <span><code>Point</code></span>. The body is a docstring that explains what the class is for. You can define variables and methods inside a class definition, but we will get back to that later.</p>
<p>Defining a class named <span><code>Point</code></span> creates a <span><strong>class object</strong></span>.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; Point
&lt;class &#39;__main__.Point&#39;&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Because <span><code>Point</code></span> is defined at the top level, its “full name” is <code>__main__.Point</code>.</p>
<p>The class object is like a factory for creating objects. To create a Point, you call <span><code>Point</code></span> as if it were a function.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; blank = Point()
&gt;&gt;&gt; blank
&lt;__main__.Point object at 0xb7e9d3ac&gt;</code></pre>
<p>The return value is a reference to a Point object, which we assign to <span><code>blank</code></span>.</p>
<p>Creating a new object is called <span><strong>instantiation</strong></span>, and the object is an <span><strong>instance</strong></span> of the class.</p>
<p>When you print an instance, Python tells you what class it belongs to and where it is stored in memory (the prefix <span><code>0x</code></span> means that the following number is in hexadecimal).</p>
<p>Every object is an instance of some class, so “object” and “instance” are interchangeable. But in this chapter I use “instance” to indicate that I am talking about a programmer-defined type.</p>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>Attributes</span> <span id="attributes" label="attributes">[attributes]</span></p>
<p>You can assign values to an instance using dot notation:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; blank.x = 3.0
&gt;&gt;&gt; blank.y = 4.0</code></pre>
<p>This syntax is similar to the syntax for selecting a variable from a module, such as <span><code>math.pi</code></span> or <span><code>string.whitespace</code></span>. In this case, though, we are assigning values to named elements of an object. These elements are called <span><strong>attributes</strong></span>.</p>
<p>As a noun, “AT-trib-ute” is pronounced with emphasis on the first syllable, as opposed to “a-TRIB-ute”, which is a verb.</p>
<p>Figure <a href="#fig.point" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig.point">16.1</a> is a state diagram that shows the result of these assignments. A state diagram that shows an object and its attributes is called an <span><strong>object diagram</strong></span>.</p>
<figure>
<embed src="figs/point.pdf" id="fig.point" /><figcaption>Object diagram.<span label="fig.point"></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The variable <span><code>blank</code></span> refers to a Point object, which contains two attributes. Each attribute refers to a floating-point number.</p>
<p>You can read the value of an attribute using the same syntax:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; blank.y
4.0
&gt;&gt;&gt; x = blank.x
&gt;&gt;&gt; x
3.0</code></pre>
<p>The expression <span><code>blank.x</code></span> means, “Go to the object <span><code>blank</code></span> refers to and get the value of <span><code>x</code></span>.” In the example, we assign that value to a variable named <span><code>x</code></span>. There is no conflict between the variable <span><code>x</code></span> and the attribute <span><code>x</code></span>.</p>
<p>You can use dot notation as part of any expression. For example:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; &#39;(%g, %g)&#39; % (blank.x, blank.y)
&#39;(3.0, 4.0)&#39;
&gt;&gt;&gt; distance = math.sqrt(blank.x**2 + blank.y**2)
&gt;&gt;&gt; distance
5.0</code></pre>
<p>You can pass an instance as an argument in the usual way. For example:</p>
<pre><code>def print_point(p):
    print(&#39;(%g, %g)&#39; % (p.x, p.y))</code></pre>
<p><code>print_point</code> takes a point as an argument and displays it in mathematical notation. To invoke it, you can pass <span><code>blank</code></span> as an argument:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; print_point(blank)
(3.0, 4.0)</code></pre>
<p>Inside the function, <span><code>p</code></span> is an alias for <span><code>blank</code></span>, so if the function modifies <span><code>p</code></span>, <span><code>blank</code></span> changes.</p>
<p>As an exercise, write a function called <code>distance_between_points</code> that takes two Points as arguments and returns the distance between them.</p>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>Rectangles</span> <span id="rectangles" label="rectangles">[rectangles]</span></p>
<p>Sometimes it is obvious what the attributes of an object should be, but other times you have to make decisions. For example, imagine you are designing a class to represent rectangles. What attributes would you use to specify the location and size of a rectangle? You can ignore angle; to keep things simple, assume that the rectangle is either vertical or horizontal.</p>
<p>There are at least two possibilities:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>You could specify one corner of the rectangle (or the center), the width, and the height.</p></li>
<li><p>You could specify two opposing corners.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>At this point it is hard to say whether either is better than the other, so we’ll implement the first one, just as an example.</p>
<p>Here is the class definition:</p>
<pre><code>class Rectangle:
    &quot;&quot;&quot;Represents a rectangle. 

    attributes: width, height, corner.
    &quot;&quot;&quot;</code></pre>
<p>The docstring lists the attributes: <span><code>width</code></span> and <span><code>height</code></span> are numbers; <span><code>corner</code></span> is a Point object that specifies the lower-left corner.</p>
<p>To represent a rectangle, you have to instantiate a Rectangle object and assign values to the attributes:</p>
<pre><code>box = Rectangle()
box.width = 100.0
box.height = 200.0
box.corner = Point()
box.corner.x = 0.0
box.corner.y = 0.0</code></pre>
<p>The expression <span><code>box.corner.x</code></span> means, “Go to the object <span><code>box</code></span> refers to and select the attribute named <span><code>corner</code></span>; then go to that object and select the attribute named <span><code>x</code></span>.”</p>

</figure>
<p>Figure <a href="#fig.rectangle" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig.rectangle">16.2</a> shows the state of this object. An object that is an attribute of another object is <span><strong>embedded</strong></span>.</p>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>Instances as return values</span></p>
<p>Functions can return instances. For example, <code>find_center</code> takes a <span><code>Rectangle</code></span> as an argument and returns a <span><code>Point</code></span> that contains the coordinates of the center of the <span><code>Rectangle</code></span>:</p>
<pre><code>def find_center(rect):
    p = Point()
    p.x = rect.corner.x + rect.width/2
    p.y = rect.corner.y + rect.height/2
    return p</code></pre>
<p>Here is an example that passes <span><code>box</code></span> as an argument and assigns the resulting Point to <span><code>center</code></span>:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; center = find_center(box)
&gt;&gt;&gt; print_point(center)
(50, 100)</code></pre>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>Objects are mutable</span></p>
<p>You can change the state of an object by making an assignment to one of its attributes. For example, to change the size of a rectangle without changing its position, you can modify the values of <span><code> width</code></span> and <span><code>height</code></span>:</p>
<pre><code>box.width = box.width + 50
box.height = box.height + 100</code></pre>
<p>You can also write functions that modify objects. For example, <code>grow_rectangle</code> takes a Rectangle object and two numbers, <span><code>dwidth</code></span> and <span><code>dheight</code></span>, and adds the numbers to the width and height of the rectangle:</p>
<pre><code>def grow_rectangle(rect, dwidth, dheight):
    rect.width += dwidth
    rect.height += dheight</code></pre>
<p>Here is an example that demonstrates the effect:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; box.width, box.height
(150.0, 300.0)
&gt;&gt;&gt; grow_rectangle(box, 50, 100)
&gt;&gt;&gt; box.width, box.height
(200.0, 400.0)</code></pre>
<p>Inside the function, <span><code>rect</code></span> is an alias for <span><code>box</code></span>, so when the function modifies <span><code>rect</code></span>, <span><code>box</code></span> changes.</p>
<p>As an exercise, write a function named <code>move_rectangle</code> that takes a Rectangle and two numbers named <span><code>dx</code></span> and <span><code>dy</code></span>. It should change the location of the rectangle by adding <span><code>dx</code></span> to the <span><code>x</code></span> coordinate of <span><code>corner</code></span> and adding <span><code>dy</code></span> to the <span><code>y</code></span> coordinate of <span><code>corner</code></span>.</p>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>Copying</span> <span id="copying" label="copying">[copying]</span></p>
<p>Aliasing can make a program difficult to read because changes in one place might have unexpected effects in another place. It is hard to keep track of all the variables that might refer to a given object.</p>
<p>Copying an object is often an alternative to aliasing. The <span><code>copy</code></span> module contains a function called <span><code>copy</code></span> that can duplicate any object:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; p1 = Point()
&gt;&gt;&gt; p1.x = 3.0
&gt;&gt;&gt; p1.y = 4.0

&gt;&gt;&gt; import copy
&gt;&gt;&gt; p2 = copy.copy(p1)</code></pre>
<p><span><code>p1</code></span> and <span><code>p2</code></span> contain the same data, but they are not the same Point.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; print_point(p1)
(3, 4)
&gt;&gt;&gt; print_point(p2)
(3, 4)
&gt;&gt;&gt; p1 is p2
False
&gt;&gt;&gt; p1 == p2
False</code></pre>
<p>The <span><code>is</code></span> operator indicates that <span><code>p1</code></span> and <span><code>p2</code></span> are not the same object, which is what we expected. But you might have expected <span><code>==</code></span> to yield <span><code>True</code></span> because these points contain the same data. In that case, you will be disappointed to learn that for instances, the default behavior of the <span><code>==</code></span> operator is the same as the <span><code>is</code></span> operator; it checks object identity, not object equivalence. That’s because for programmer-defined types, Python doesn’t know what should be considered equivalent. At least, not yet.</p>
<p>If you use <span><code>copy.copy</code></span> to duplicate a Rectangle, you will find that it copies the Rectangle object but not the embedded Point.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; box2 = copy.copy(box)
&gt;&gt;&gt; box2 is box
False
&gt;&gt;&gt; box2.corner is box.corner
True</code></pre>

</figure>
<p>Figure <a href="#fig.rectangle2" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig.rectangle2">16.3</a> shows what the object diagram looks like. This operation is called a <span><strong>shallow copy</strong></span> because it copies the object and any references it contains, but not the embedded objects.</p>
<p>For most applications, this is not what you want. In this example, invoking <code>grow_rectangle</code> on one of the Rectangles would not affect the other, but invoking <code>move_rectangle</code> on either would affect both! This behavior is confusing and error-prone.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the <span><code>copy</code></span> module provides a method named <span><code> deepcopy</code></span> that copies not only the object but also the objects it refers to, and the objects <span><em>they</em></span> refer to, and so on. You will not be surprised to learn that this operation is called a <span><strong>deep copy</strong></span>.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; box3 = copy.deepcopy(box)
&gt;&gt;&gt; box3 is box
False
&gt;&gt;&gt; box3.corner is box.corner
False</code></pre>
<p><span><code>box3</code></span> and <span><code>box</code></span> are completely separate objects.</p>
<p>As an exercise, write a version of <code>move_rectangle</code> that creates and returns a new Rectangle instead of modifying the old one.</p>

<p>When you start working with objects, you are likely to encounter some new exceptions. If you try to access an attribute that doesn’t exist, you get an <span><code>AttributeError</code></span>:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; p = Point()
&gt;&gt;&gt; p.x = 3
&gt;&gt;&gt; p.y = 4
&gt;&gt;&gt; p.z
AttributeError: Point instance has no attribute &#39;z&#39;</code></pre>
<p>If you are not sure what type an object is, you can ask:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; type(p)
&lt;class &#39;__main__.Point&#39;&gt;</code></pre>
<p>You can also use <span><code>isinstance</code></span> to check whether an object is an instance of a class:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; isinstance(p, Point)
True</code></pre>
<p>If you are not sure whether an object has a particular attribute, you can use the built-in function <span><code>hasattr</code></span>:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; hasattr(p, &#39;x&#39;)
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; hasattr(p, &#39;z&#39;)
False</code></pre>
<p>The first argument can be any object; the second argument is a <span> <em>string</em></span> that contains the name of the attribute.</p>
<p>You can also use a <span><code>try</code></span> statement to see if the object has the attributes you need:</p>
<pre><code>try:
    x = p.x
except AttributeError:
    x = 0</code></pre>
<p>This approach can make it easier to write functions that work with different types; more on that topic is coming up in Section <a href="#polymorphism" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="polymorphism">[polymorphism]</a>.</p>

<p>Now that we know how to create new types, the next step is to write functions that take programmer-defined objects as parameters and return them as results. In this chapter I also present “functional programming style” and two new program development plans.</p>
<p>Code examples from this chapter are available from <a href="http://thinkpython2.com/code/Time1.py">http://thinkpython2.com/code/Time1.py</a>. Solutions to the exercises are at <a href="http://thinkpython2.com/code/Time1_soln.py">http://thinkpython2.com/code/Time1_soln.py</a>.</p>

<p>As another example of a programmer-defined type, we’ll define a class called <span><code>Time</code></span> that records the time of day. The class definition looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>class Time:
    &quot;&quot;&quot;Represents the time of day.
       
    attributes: hour, minute, second
    &quot;&quot;&quot;</code></pre>
<p>We can create a new <span><code>Time</code></span> object and assign attributes for hours, minutes, and seconds:</p>
<pre><code>time = Time()
time.hour = 11
time.minute = 59
time.second = 30</code></pre>
<p>The state diagram for the <span><code>Time</code></span> object looks like Figure <a href="#fig.time" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig.time">17.1</a>.</p>
<p>As an exercise, write a function called <code>print_time</code> that takes a Time object and prints it in the form <span><code>hour:minute:second</code></span>. Hint: the format sequence <code>'%.2d'</code> prints an integer using at least two digits, including a leading zero if necessary.</p>
<p>Write a boolean function called <code>is_after</code> that takes two Time objects, <span><code>t1</code></span> and <span><code>t2</code></span>, and returns <span><code>True</code></span> if <span><code>t1</code></span> follows <span><code>t2</code></span> chronologically and <span><code>False</code></span> otherwise. Challenge: don’t use an <span><code>if</code></span> statement.</p>

<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>Pure functions</span></p>
<p>In the next few sections, we’ll write two functions that add time values. They demonstrate two kinds of functions: pure functions and modifiers. They also demonstrate a development plan I’ll call <span> <strong>prototype and patch</strong></span>, which is a way of tackling a complex problem by starting with a simple prototype and incrementally dealing with the complications.</p>
<p>Here is a simple prototype of <code>add_time</code>:</p>
<pre><code>def add_time(t1, t2):
    sum = Time()
    sum.hour = t1.hour + t2.hour
    sum.minute = t1.minute + t2.minute
    sum.second = t1.second + t2.second
    return sum</code></pre>
<p>The function creates a new <span><code>Time</code></span> object, initializes its attributes, and returns a reference to the new object. This is called a <span><strong>pure function</strong></span> because it does not modify any of the objects passed to it as arguments and it has no effect, like displaying a value or getting user input, other than returning a value.</p>
<p>To test this function, I’ll create two Time objects: <span><code>start</code></span> contains the start time of a movie, like <span><em>Monty Python and the Holy Grail</em></span>, and <span><code>duration</code></span> contains the run time of the movie, which is one hour 35 minutes.</p>
<p><code>add_time</code> figures out when the movie will be done.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; start = Time()
&gt;&gt;&gt; start.hour = 9
&gt;&gt;&gt; start.minute = 45
&gt;&gt;&gt; start.second =  0

&gt;&gt;&gt; duration = Time()
&gt;&gt;&gt; duration.hour = 1
&gt;&gt;&gt; duration.minute = 35
&gt;&gt;&gt; duration.second = 0

&gt;&gt;&gt; done = add_time(start, duration)
&gt;&gt;&gt; print_time(done)
10:80:00</code></pre>
<p>The result, <span><code>10:80:00</code></span> might not be what you were hoping for. The problem is that this function does not deal with cases where the number of seconds or minutes adds up to more than sixty. When that happens, we have to “carry” the extra seconds into the minute column or the extra minutes into the hour column.</p>
<p>Here’s an improved version:</p>
<pre><code>def add_time(t1, t2):
    sum = Time()
    sum.hour = t1.hour + t2.hour
    sum.minute = t1.minute + t2.minute
    sum.second = t1.second + t2.second

    if sum.second &gt;= 60:
        sum.second -= 60
        sum.minute += 1

    if sum.minute &gt;= 60:
        sum.minute -= 60
        sum.hour += 1

    return sum</code></pre>
<p>Although this function is correct, it is starting to get big. We will see a shorter alternative later.</p>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>Modifiers</span> <span id="increment" label="increment">[increment]</span></p>
<p>Sometimes it is useful for a function to modify the objects it gets as parameters. In that case, the changes are visible to the caller. Functions that work this way are called <span><strong>modifiers</strong></span>.</p>
<p><span><code>increment</code></span>, which adds a given number of seconds to a <span><code>Time</code></span> object, can be written naturally as a modifier. Here is a rough draft:</p>
<pre><code>def increment(time, seconds):
    time.second += seconds

    if time.second &gt;= 60:
        time.second -= 60
        time.minute += 1

    if time.minute &gt;= 60:
        time.minute -= 60
        time.hour += 1</code></pre>
<p>The first line performs the basic operation; the remainder deals with the special cases we saw before.</p>
<p>Is this function correct? What happens if <span><code>seconds</code></span> is much greater than sixty?</p>
<p>In that case, it is not enough to carry once; we have to keep doing it until <span><code>time.second</code></span> is less than sixty. One solution is to replace the <span><code>if</code></span> statements with <span><code>while</code></span> statements. That would make the function correct, but not very efficient. As an exercise, write a correct version of <span><code>increment</code></span> that doesn’t contain any loops.</p>
<p>Anything that can be done with modifiers can also be done with pure functions. In fact, some programming languages only allow pure functions. There is some evidence that programs that use pure functions are faster to develop and less error-prone than programs that use modifiers. But modifiers are convenient at times, and functional programs tend to be less efficient.</p>
<p>In general, I recommend that you write pure functions whenever it is reasonable and resort to modifiers only if there is a compelling advantage. This approach might be called a <span><strong>functional programming style</strong></span>.</p>
<p>As an exercise, write a “pure” version of <span><code>increment</code></span> that creates and returns a new Time object rather than modifying the parameter.</p>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>Prototyping versus planning</span> <span id="prototype" label="prototype">[prototype]</span></p>
<p>The development plan I am demonstrating is called “prototype and patch”. For each function, I wrote a prototype that performed the basic calculation and then tested it, patching errors along the way.</p>
<p>This approach can be effective, especially if you don’t yet have a deep understanding of the problem. But incremental corrections can generate code that is unnecessarily complicated—since it deals with many special cases—and unreliable—since it is hard to know if you have found all the errors.</p>
<p>An alternative is <span><strong>designed development</strong></span>, in which high-level insight into the problem can make the programming much easier. In this case, the insight is that a Time object is really a three-digit number in base 60 (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexagesimal">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexagesimal</a>.)! The <span><code>second</code></span> attribute is the “ones column”, the <span><code>minute</code></span> attribute is the “sixties column”, and the <span><code>hour</code></span> attribute is the “thirty-six hundreds column”.</p>
<p>When we wrote <code>add_time</code> and <span><code>increment</code></span>, we were effectively doing addition in base 60, which is why we had to carry from one column to the next.</p>
<p>This observation suggests another approach to the whole problem—we can convert Time objects to integers and take advantage of the fact that the computer knows how to do integer arithmetic.</p>
<p>Here is a function that converts Times to integers:</p>
<pre><code>def time_to_int(time):
    minutes = time.hour * 60 + time.minute
    seconds = minutes * 60 + time.second
    return seconds</code></pre>
<p>And here is a function that converts an integer to a Time (recall that <span><code>divmod</code></span> divides the first argument by the second and returns the quotient and remainder as a tuple).</p>
<pre><code>def int_to_time(seconds):
    time = Time()
    minutes, time.second = divmod(seconds, 60)
    time.hour, time.minute = divmod(minutes, 60)
    return time</code></pre>
<p>You might have to think a bit, and run some tests, to convince yourself that these functions are correct. One way to test them is to check that <code>time_to_int(int_to_time(x)) == x</code> for many values of <span><code>x</code></span>. This is an example of a consistency check.</p>
<p>Once you are convinced they are correct, you can use them to rewrite <code>add_time</code>:</p>
<pre><code>def add_time(t1, t2):
    seconds = time_to_int(t1) + time_to_int(t2)
    return int_to_time(seconds)</code></pre>
<p>This version is shorter than the original, and easier to verify. As an exercise, rewrite <span><code>increment</code></span> using <code>time_to_int</code> and <code>int_to_time</code>.</p>
<p>In some ways, converting from base 60 to base 10 and back is harder than just dealing with times. Base conversion is more abstract; our intuition for dealing with time values is better.</p>
<p>But if we have the insight to treat times as base 60 numbers and make the investment of writing the conversion functions (<code>time_to_int</code> and <code>int_to_time</code>), we get a program that is shorter, easier to read and debug, and more reliable.</p>
<p>It is also easier to add features later. For example, imagine subtracting two Times to find the duration between them. The naive approach would be to implement subtraction with borrowing. Using the conversion functions would be easier and more likely to be correct.</p>
<p>Ironically, sometimes making a problem harder (or more general) makes it easier (because there are fewer special cases and fewer opportunities for error).</p>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>Debugging</span></p>
<p>A Time object is well-formed if the values of <span><code>minute</code></span> and <span><code> second</code></span> are between 0 and 60 (including 0 but not 60) and if <span><code>hour</code></span> is positive. <span><code>hour</code></span> and <span><code>minute</code></span> should be integral values, but we might allow <span><code>second</code></span> to have a fraction part.</p>
<p>Requirements like these are called <span><strong>invariants</strong></span> because they should always be true. To put it a different way, if they are not true, something has gone wrong.</p>
<p>Writing code to check invariants can help detect errors and find their causes. For example, you might have a function like <code>valid_time</code> that takes a Time object and returns <span><code>False</code></span> if it violates an invariant:</p>
<pre><code>def valid_time(time):
    if time.hour &lt; 0 or time.minute &lt; 0 or time.second &lt; 0:
        return False
    if time.minute &gt;= 60 or time.second &gt;= 60:
        return False
    return True</code></pre>
<p>At the beginning of each function you could check the arguments to make sure they are valid:</p>
<pre><code>def add_time(t1, t2):
    if not valid_time(t1) or not valid_time(t2):
        raise ValueError(&#39;invalid Time object in add_time&#39;)
    seconds = time_to_int(t1) + time_to_int(t2)
    return int_to_time(seconds)</code></pre>
<p>Or you could use an <span><strong>assert statement</strong></span>, which checks a given invariant and raises an exception if it fails:</p>
<pre><code>def add_time(t1, t2):
    assert valid_time(t1) and valid_time(t2)
    seconds = time_to_int(t1) + time_to_int(t2)
    return int_to_time(seconds)</code></pre>
<p><span><code>assert</code></span> statements are useful because they distinguish code that deals with normal conditions from code that checks for errors.</p>

<h1 id="classes-and-methods">Classes and methods</h1>
<p>Although we are using some of Python’s object-oriented features, the programs from the last two chapters are not really object-oriented because they don’t represent the relationships between programmer-defined types and the functions that operate on them. The next step is to transform those functions into methods that make the relationships explicit.</p>
<p>Code examples from this chapter are available from <a href="http://thinkpython2.com/code/Time2.py">http://thinkpython2.com/code/Time2.py</a>, and solutions to the exercises are in <a href="http://thinkpython2.com/code/Point2_soln.py">http://thinkpython2.com/code/Point2_soln.py</a>.</p>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>Object-oriented features</span></p>
<p>Python is an <span><strong>object-oriented programming language</strong></span>, which means that it provides features that support object-oriented programming, which has these defining characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Programs include class and method definitions.</p></li>
<li><p>Most of the computation is expressed in terms of operations on objects.</p></li>
<li><p>Objects often represent things in the real world, and methods often correspond to the ways things in the real world interact.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>For example, the <span><code>Time</code></span> class defined in Chapter <a href="#time" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="time">17</a> corresponds to the way people record the time of day, and the functions we defined correspond to the kinds of things people do with times. Similarly, the <span><code>Point</code></span> and <span><code>Rectangle</code></span> classes in Chapter <a href="#clobjects" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="clobjects">16</a> correspond to the mathematical concepts of a point and a rectangle.</p>
<p>So far, we have not taken advantage of the features Python provides to support object-oriented programming. These features are not strictly necessary; most of them provide alternative syntax for things we have already done. But in many cases, the alternative is more concise and more accurately conveys the structure of the program.</p>
<p>For example, in <span><code>Time1.py</code></span> there is no obvious connection between the class definition and the function definitions that follow. With some examination, it is apparent that every function takes at least one <span><code>Time</code></span> object as an argument.</p>
<p>This observation is the motivation for <span><strong>methods</strong></span>; a method is a function that is associated with a particular class. We have seen methods for strings, lists, dictionaries and tuples. In this chapter, we will define methods for programmer-defined types.</p>
<p>Methods are semantically the same as functions, but there are two syntactic differences:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Methods are defined inside a class definition in order to make the relationship between the class and the method explicit.</p></li>
<li><p>The syntax for invoking a method is different from the syntax for calling a function.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In the next few sections, we will take the functions from the previous two chapters and transform them into methods. This transformation is purely mechanical; you can do it by following a sequence of steps.

<p>In Chapter <a href="#time" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="time">17</a>, we defined a class named <span><code>Time</code></span> and in Section <a href="#isafter" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="isafter">[isafter]</a>, you wrote a function named <code>print_time</code>:</p>
<pre><code>class Time:
    &quot;&quot;&quot;Represents the time of day.&quot;&quot;&quot;

def print_time(time):
    print(&#39;%.2d:%.2d:%.2d&#39; % (time.hour, time.minute, time.second))</code></pre>
<p>To call this function, you have to pass a <span><code>Time</code></span> object as an argument:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; start = Time()
&gt;&gt;&gt; start.hour = 9
&gt;&gt;&gt; start.minute = 45
&gt;&gt;&gt; start.second = 00
&gt;&gt;&gt; print_time(start)
09:45:00</code></pre>
<p>To make <code>print_time</code> a method, all we have to do is move the function definition inside the class definition. Notice the change in indentation.</p>
<pre><code>class Time:
    def print_time(time):
        print(&#39;%.2d:%.2d:%.2d&#39; % (time.hour, time.minute, time.second))</code></pre>
<p>Now there are two ways to call <code>print_time</code>. The first (and less common) way is to use function syntax:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; Time.print_time(start)
09:45:00</code></pre>
<p>In this use of dot notation, <span><code>Time</code></span> is the name of the class, and <code>print_time</code> is the name of the method. <span><code>start</code></span> is passed as a parameter.</p>
<p>The second (and more concise) way is to use method syntax:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; start.print_time()
09:45:00</code></pre>
<p>In this use of dot notation, <code>print_time</code> is the name of the method (again), and <span><code>start</code></span> is the object the method is invoked on, which is called the <span><strong>subject</strong></span>. Just as the subject of a sentence is what the sentence is about, the subject of a method invocation is what the method is about.</p>
<p>Inside the method, the subject is assigned to the first parameter, so in this case <span><code>start</code></span> is assigned to <span><code>time</code></span>.</p>
<p>By convention, the first parameter of a method is called <span><code>self</code></span>, so it would be more common to write <code>print_time</code> like this:</p>
<pre><code>class Time:
    def print_time(self):
        print(&#39;%.2d:%.2d:%.2d&#39; % (self.hour, self.minute, self.second))</code></pre>
<p>The reason for this convention is an implicit metaphor:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The syntax for a function call, <code>print_time(start)</code>, suggests that the function is the active agent. It says something like, “Hey <code>print_time</code>! Here’s an object for you to print.”</p></li>
<li><p>In object-oriented programming, the objects are the active agents. A method invocation like <code>start.print_time()</code> says “Hey <span><code>start</code></span>! Please print yourself.”</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This change in perspective might be more polite, but it is not obvious that it is useful. In the examples we have seen so far, it may not be. But sometimes shifting responsibility from the functions onto the objects makes it possible to write more versatile functions (or methods), and makes it easier to maintain and reuse code.</p>
<p>As an exercise, rewrite <code>time_to_int</code> (from Section <a href="#prototype" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="prototype">[prototype]</a>) as a method. You might be tempted to rewrite <code>int_to_time</code> as a method, too, but that doesn’t really make sense because there would be no object to invoke it on.</p>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>Another example</span></p>
<p>Here’s a version of <span><code>increment</code></span> (from Section <a href="#increment" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="increment">[increment]</a>) rewritten as a method:</p>
<pre><code># inside class Time:

    def increment(self, seconds):
        seconds += self.time_to_int()
        return int_to_time(seconds)</code></pre>
<p>This version assumes that <code>time_to_int</code> is written as a method. Also, note that it is a pure function, not a modifier.</p>
<p>Here’s how you would invoke <span><code>increment</code></span>:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; start.print_time()
09:45:00
&gt;&gt;&gt; end = start.increment(1337)
&gt;&gt;&gt; end.print_time()
10:07:17</code></pre>
<p>The subject, <span><code>start</code></span>, gets assigned to the first parameter, <span><code>self</code></span>. The argument, <span><code>1337</code></span>, gets assigned to the second parameter, <span><code>seconds</code></span>.</p>
<p>This mechanism can be confusing, especially if you make an error. For example, if you invoke <span><code>increment</code></span> with two arguments, you get:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; end = start.increment(1337, 460)
TypeError: increment() takes 2 positional arguments but 3 were given</code></pre>
<p>The error message is initially confusing, because there are only two arguments in parentheses. But the subject is also considered an argument, so all together that’s three.</p>
<p>By the way, a <span><strong>positional argument</strong></span> is an argument that doesn’t have a parameter name; that is, it is not a keyword argument. In this function call:</p>
<pre><code>sketch(parrot, cage, dead=True)</code></pre>
<p><span><code>parrot</code></span> and <span><code>cage</code></span> are positional, and <span><code>dead</code></span> is a keyword argument.</p>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>A more complicated example</span></p>
<p>Rewriting <code>is_after</code> (from Section <a href="#isafter" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="isafter">[isafter]</a>) is slightly more complicated because it takes two Time objects as parameters. In this case it is conventional to name the first parameter <span><code>self</code></span> and the second parameter <span><code>other</code></span>:</p>
<pre><code># inside class Time:

    def is_after(self, other):
        return self.time_to_int() &gt; other.time_to_int()</code></pre>
<p>To use this method, you have to invoke it on one object and pass the other as an argument:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; end.is_after(start)
True</code></pre>
<p>One nice thing about this syntax is that it almost reads like English: “end is after start?”</p>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>The init method</span></p>
<p>The init method (short for “initialization”) is a special method that gets invoked when an object is instantiated. Its full name is <code>__init__</code> (two underscore characters, followed by <span><code>init</code></span>, and then two more underscores). An init method for the <span><code>Time</code></span> class might look like this:</p>
<pre><code># inside class Time:

    def __init__(self, hour=0, minute=0, second=0):
        self.hour = hour
        self.minute = minute
        self.second = second</code></pre>
<p>It is common for the parameters of <code>__init__</code> to have the same names as the attributes. The statement</p>
<pre><code>        self.hour = hour</code></pre>
<p>stores the value of the parameter <span><code>hour</code></span> as an attribute of <span><code>self</code></span>.</p>
<p>The parameters are optional, so if you call <span><code>Time</code></span> with no arguments, you get the default values.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; time = Time()
&gt;&gt;&gt; time.print_time()
00:00:00</code></pre>
<p>If you provide one argument, it overrides <span><code>hour</code></span>:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; time = Time (9)
&gt;&gt;&gt; time.print_time()
09:00:00</code></pre>
<p>If you provide two arguments, they override <span><code>hour</code></span> and <span><code>minute</code></span>.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; time = Time(9, 45)
&gt;&gt;&gt; time.print_time()
09:45:00</code></pre>
<p>And if you provide three arguments, they override all three default values.</p>
<p>As an exercise, write an init method for the <span><code>Point</code></span> class that takes <span><code>x</code></span> and <span><code>y</code></span> as optional parameters and assigns them to the corresponding attributes.</p>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>The <span><code>__str__</code></span> method</span></p>
<p><code>__str__</code> is a special method, like <code>__init__</code>, that is supposed to return a string representation of an object.</p>
<p>For example, here is a <span><code>str</code></span> method for Time objects:</p>
<pre><code># inside class Time:

    def __str__(self):
        return &#39;%.2d:%.2d:%.2d&#39; % (self.hour, self.minute, self.second)</code></pre>
<p>When you <span><code>print</code></span> an object, Python invokes the <span><code>str</code></span> method:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; time = Time(9, 45)
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(time)
09:45:00</code></pre>
<p>When I write a new class, I almost always start by writing <code>__init__</code>, which makes it easier to instantiate objects, and <code>__str__</code>, which is useful for debugging.</p>
<p>As an exercise, write a <span><code>str</code></span> method for the <span><code>Point</code></span> class. Create a Point object and print it.</p>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>Operator overloading</span> <span id="operator.overloading" label="operator.overloading">[operator.overloading]</span></p>
<p>By defining other special methods, you can specify the behavior of operators on programmer-defined types. For example, if you define a method named <code>__add__</code> for the <span><code>Time</code></span> class, you can use the <span><code>+</code></span> operator on Time objects.</p>
<p>Here is what the definition might look like:</p>
<pre><code># inside class Time:

    def __add__(self, other):
        seconds = self.time_to_int() + other.time_to_int()
        return int_to_time(seconds)</code></pre>
<p>And here is how you could use it:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; start = Time(9, 45)
&gt;&gt;&gt; duration = Time(1, 35)
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(start + duration)
11:20:00</code></pre>
<p>When you apply the <span><code>+</code></span> operator to Time objects, Python invokes <code>__add__</code>. When you print the result, Python invokes <code>__str__</code>. So there is a lot happening behind the scenes!</p>
<p>Changing the behavior of an operator so that it works with programmer-defined types is called <span><strong>operator overloading</strong></span>. For every operator in Python there is a corresponding special method, like <code>__add__</code>. For more details, see <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#specialnames">http://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#specialnames</a>.</p>
<p>As an exercise, write an <span><code>add</code></span> method for the Point class.</p>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>Type-based dispatch</span></p>
<p>In the previous section we added two Time objects, but you also might want to add an integer to a Time object. The following is a version of <code>__add__</code> that checks the type of <span><code>other</code></span> and invokes either <code>add_time</code> or <span><code>increment</code></span>:</p>
<pre><code># inside class Time:

    def __add__(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, Time):
            return self.add_time(other)
        else:
            return self.increment(other)

    def add_time(self, other):
        seconds = self.time_to_int() + other.time_to_int()
        return int_to_time(seconds)

    def increment(self, seconds):
        seconds += self.time_to_int()
        return int_to_time(seconds)</code></pre>
<p>The built-in function <span><code>isinstance</code></span> takes a value and a class object, and returns <span><code>True</code></span> if the value is an instance of the class.</p>
<p>If <span><code>other</code></span> is a Time object, <code>__add__</code> invokes <code>add_time</code>. Otherwise it assumes that the parameter is a number and invokes <span><code>increment</code></span>. This operation is called a <span><strong>type-based dispatch</strong></span> because it dispatches the computation to different methods based on the type of the arguments.</p>
<p>Here are examples that use the <span><code>+</code></span> operator with different types:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; start = Time(9, 45)
&gt;&gt;&gt; duration = Time(1, 35)
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(start + duration)
11:20:00
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(start + 1337)
10:07:17</code></pre>
<p>Unfortunately, this implementation of addition is not commutative. If the integer is the first operand, you get</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; print(1337 + start)
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: &#39;int&#39; and &#39;instance&#39;</code></pre>
<p>The problem is, instead of asking the Time object to add an integer, Python is asking an integer to add a Time object, and it doesn’t know how. But there is a clever solution for this problem: the special method <code>__radd__</code>, which stands for “right-side add”. This method is invoked when a Time object appears on the right side of the <span><code>+</code></span> operator. Here’s the definition:</p>
<pre><code># inside class Time:

    def __radd__(self, other):
        return self.__add__(other)</code></pre>
<p>And here’s how it’s used:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; print(1337 + start)
10:07:17</code></pre>
<p>As an exercise, write an <span><code>add</code></span> method for Points that works with either a Point object or a tuple:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If the second operand is a Point, the method should return a new Point whose <span class="math inline"><em>x</em></span> coordinate is the sum of the <span class="math inline"><em>x</em></span> coordinates of the operands, and likewise for the <span class="math inline"><em>y</em></span> coordinates.</p></li>
<li><p>If the second operand is a tuple, the method should add the first element of the tuple to the <span class="math inline"><em>x</em></span> coordinate and the second element to the <span class="math inline"><em>y</em></span> coordinate, and return a new Point with the result.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>Polymorphism</span> <span id="polymorphism" label="polymorphism">[polymorphism]</span></p>
<p>Type-based dispatch is useful when it is necessary, but (fortunately) it is not always necessary. Often you can avoid it by writing functions that work correctly for arguments with different types.</p>
<p>Many of the functions we wrote for strings also work for other sequence types. For example, in Section <a href="#histogram" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="histogram">[histogram]</a> we used <span><code>histogram</code></span> to count the number of times each letter appears in a word.</p>
<pre><code>def histogram(s):
    d = dict()
    for c in s:
        if c not in d:
            d[c] = 1
        else:
            d[c] = d[c]+1
    return d</code></pre>
<p>This function also works for lists, tuples, and even dictionaries, as long as the elements of <span><code>s</code></span> are hashable, so they can be used as keys in <span><code>d</code></span>.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; t = [&#39;spam&#39;, &#39;egg&#39;, &#39;spam&#39;, &#39;spam&#39;, &#39;bacon&#39;, &#39;spam&#39;]
&gt;&gt;&gt; histogram(t)
{&#39;bacon&#39;: 1, &#39;egg&#39;: 1, &#39;spam&#39;: 4}</code></pre>
<p>Functions that work with several types are called <span><strong>polymorphic</strong></span>. Polymorphism can facilitate code reuse. For example, the built-in function <span><code>sum</code></span>, which adds the elements of a sequence, works as long as the elements of the sequence support addition.</p>
<p>Since Time objects provide an <span><code>add</code></span> method, they work with <span><code>sum</code></span>:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; t1 = Time(7, 43)
&gt;&gt;&gt; t2 = Time(7, 41)
&gt;&gt;&gt; t3 = Time(7, 37)
&gt;&gt;&gt; total = sum([t1, t2, t3])
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(total)
23:01:00</code></pre>
<p>In general, if all of the operations inside a function work with a given type, the function works with that type.</p>
<p>The best kind of polymorphism is the unintentional kind, where you discover that a function you already wrote can be applied to a type you never planned for.</p>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>Debugging</span></p>
<p>It is legal to add attributes to objects at any point in the execution of a program, but if you have objects with the same type that don’t have the same attributes, it is easy to make mistakes. It is considered a good idea to initialize all of an object’s attributes in the init method.</p>
<p>If you are not sure whether an object has a particular attribute, you can use the built-in function <span><code>hasattr</code></span> (see Section <a href="#hasattr" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="hasattr">[hasattr]</a>).</p>
<p>Another way to access attributes is the built-in function <span><code>vars</code></span>, which takes an object and returns a dictionary that maps from attribute names (as strings) to their values:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; p = Point(3, 4)
&gt;&gt;&gt; vars(p)
{&#39;y&#39;: 4, &#39;x&#39;: 3}</code></pre>
<p>For purposes of debugging, you might find it useful to keep this function handy:</p>
<pre><code>def print_attributes(obj):
    for attr in vars(obj):
        print(attr, getattr(obj, attr))</code></pre>
<p><code>print_attributes</code> traverses the dictionary and prints each attribute name and its corresponding value.</p>
<p>The built-in function <span><code>getattr</code></span> takes an object and an attribute name (as a string) and returns the attribute’s value.</p>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>Interface and implementation</span></p>
<p>One of the goals of object-oriented design is to make software more maintainable, which means that you can keep the program working when other parts of the system change, and modify the program to meet new requirements.</p>
<p>A design principle that helps achieve that goal is to keep interfaces separate from implementations. For objects, that means that the methods a class provides should not depend on how the attributes are represented.</p>
<p>For example, in this chapter we developed a class that represents a time of day. Methods provided by this class include <code>time_to_int</code>, <code>is_after</code>, and <code>add_time</code>.</p>
<p>We could implement those methods in several ways. The details of the implementation depend on how we represent time. In this chapter, the attributes of a <span><code>Time</code></span> object are <span><code>hour</code></span>, <span><code>minute</code></span>, and <span><code>second</code></span>.</p>
<p>As an alternative, we could replace these attributes with a single integer representing the number of seconds since midnight. This implementation would make some methods, like <code>is_after</code>, easier to write, but it makes other methods harder.</p>
<p>After you deploy a new class, you might discover a better implementation. If other parts of the program are using your class, it might be time-consuming and error-prone to change the interface.</p>
<p>But if you designed the interface carefully, you can change the implementation without changing the interface, which means that other parts of the program don’t have to change.</p>

<h1 id="inheritance">Inheritance</h1>
<p>The language feature most often associated with object-oriented programming is <span><strong>inheritance</strong></span>. Inheritance is the ability to define a new class that is a modified version of an existing class. In this chapter I demonstrate inheritance using classes that represent playing cards, decks of cards, and poker hands.</p>
<p>If you don’t play poker, you can read about it at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poker">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poker</a>, but you don’t have to; I’ll tell you what you need to know for the exercises.</p>
<p>Code examples from this chapter are available from <a href="http://thinkpython2.com/code/Card.py">http://thinkpython2.com/code/Card.py</a>.</p>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>Card objects</span></p>
<p>There are fifty-two cards in a deck, each of which belongs to one of four suits and one of thirteen ranks. The suits are Spades, Hearts, Diamonds, and Clubs (in descending order in bridge). The ranks are Ace, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, and King. Depending on the game that you are playing, an Ace may be higher than King or lower than 2.</p>
<p>If we want to define a new object to represent a playing card, it is obvious what the attributes should be: <span><code>rank</code></span> and <span><code>suit</code></span>. It is not as obvious what type the attributes should be. One possibility is to use strings containing words like <code>'Spade'</code> for suits and <code>'Queen'</code> for ranks. One problem with this implementation is that it would not be easy to compare cards to see which had a higher rank or suit.</p>
<p>An alternative is to use integers to <span><strong>encode</strong></span> the ranks and suits. In this context, “encode” means that we are going to define a mapping between numbers and suits, or between numbers and ranks. This kind of encoding is not meant to be a secret (that would be “encryption”).</p>
<p>For example, this table shows the suits and the corresponding integer codes:</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td style="text-align: left;">Spades</td>
<td style="text-align: center;"><span class="math inline">↦</span></td>
<td style="text-align: left;">3</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td style="text-align: left;">Hearts</td>
<td style="text-align: center;"><span class="math inline">↦</span></td>
<td style="text-align: left;">2</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td style="text-align: left;">Diamonds</td>
<td style="text-align: center;"><span class="math inline">↦</span></td>
<td style="text-align: left;">1</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td style="text-align: left;">Clubs</td>
<td style="text-align: center;"><span class="math inline">↦</span></td>
<td style="text-align: left;">0</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>This code makes it easy to compare cards; because higher suits map to higher numbers, we can compare suits by comparing their codes.</p>
<p>The mapping for ranks is fairly obvious; each of the numerical ranks maps to the corresponding integer, and for face cards:</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td style="text-align: left;">Jack</td>
<td style="text-align: center;"><span class="math inline">↦</span></td>
<td style="text-align: left;">11</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td style="text-align: left;">Queen</td>
<td style="text-align: center;"><span class="math inline">↦</span></td>
<td style="text-align: left;">12</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td style="text-align: left;">King</td>
<td style="text-align: center;"><span class="math inline">↦</span></td>
<td style="text-align: left;">13</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>I am using the <span class="math inline">↦</span> symbol to make it clear that these mappings are not part of the Python program. They are part of the program design, but they don’t appear explicitly in the code.</p>
<p>The class definition for <span><code>Card</code></span> looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>class Card:
    &quot;&quot;&quot;Represents a standard playing card.&quot;&quot;&quot;

    def __init__(self, suit=0, rank=2):
        self.suit = suit
        self.rank = rank</code></pre>
<p>As usual, the init method takes an optional parameter for each attribute. The default card is the 2 of Clubs.</p>
<p>To create a Card, you call <span><code>Card</code></span> with the suit and rank of the card you want.</p>
<pre><code>queen_of_diamonds = Card(1, 12)</code></pre>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>Class attributes</span> <span id="class.attribute" label="class.attribute">[class.attribute]</span></p>
<p>In order to print Card objects in a way that people can easily read, we need a mapping from the integer codes to the corresponding ranks and suits. A natural way to do that is with lists of strings. We assign these lists to <span><strong>class attributes</strong></span>:</p>
<pre><code># inside class Card:

    suit_names = [&#39;Clubs&#39;, &#39;Diamonds&#39;, &#39;Hearts&#39;, &#39;Spades&#39;]
    rank_names = [None, &#39;Ace&#39;, &#39;2&#39;, &#39;3&#39;, &#39;4&#39;, &#39;5&#39;, &#39;6&#39;, &#39;7&#39;, 
              &#39;8&#39;, &#39;9&#39;, &#39;10&#39;, &#39;Jack&#39;, &#39;Queen&#39;, &#39;King&#39;]

    def __str__(self):
        return &#39;%s of %s&#39; % (Card.rank_names[self.rank],
                             Card.suit_names[self.suit])</code></pre>
<p>Variables like <code>suit_names</code> and <code>rank_names</code>, which are defined inside a class but outside of any method, are called class attributes because they are associated with the class object <span><code>Card</code></span>.</p>
<p>This term distinguishes them from variables like <span><code>suit</code></span> and <span><code> rank</code></span>, which are called <span><strong>instance attributes</strong></span> because they are associated with a particular instance.</p>
<p>Both kinds of attribute are accessed using dot notation. For example, in <code>__str__</code>, <span><code>self</code></span> is a Card object, and <span><code>self.rank</code></span> is its rank. Similarly, <span><code>Card</code></span> is a class object, and <code>Card.rank_names</code> is a list of strings associated with the class.</p>
<p>Every card has its own <span><code>suit</code></span> and <span><code>rank</code></span>, but there is only one copy of <code>suit_names</code> and <code>rank_names</code>.</p>
<p>Putting it all together, the expression <code>Card.rank_names[self.rank]</code> means “use the attribute <span><code>rank</code></span> from the object <span><code>self</code></span> as an index into the list <code>rank_names</code> from the class <span><code>Card</code></span>, and select the appropriate string.”</p>
<p>The first element of <code>rank_names</code> is <span><code>None</code></span> because there is no card with rank zero. By including <span><code>None</code></span> as a place-keeper, we get a mapping with the nice property that the index 2 maps to the string <code>'2'</code>, and so on. To avoid this tweak, we could have used a dictionary instead of a list.</p>
<p>With the methods we have so far, we can create and print cards:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; card1 = Card(2, 11)
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(card1)
Jack of Hearts</code></pre>

<p>Figure <a href="#fig.card1" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig.card1">19.1</a> is a diagram of the <span><code>Card</code></span> class object and one Card instance. <span><code>Card</code></span> is a class object; its type is <span><code> type</code></span>. <span><code>card1</code></span> is an instance of <span><code>Card</code></span>, so its type is <span><code>Card</code></span>. To save space, I didn’t draw the contents of <code>suit_names</code> and <code>rank_names</code>.</p>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>Comparing cards</span> <span id="comparecard" label="comparecard">[comparecard]</span></p>
<p>For built-in types, there are relational operators (<span><code>&lt;</code></span>, <span><code>&gt;</code></span>, <span><code>==</code></span>, etc.) that compare values and determine when one is greater than, less than, or equal to another. For programmer-defined types, we can override the behavior of the built-in operators by providing a method named <code>__lt__</code>, which stands for “less than”.</p>
<p><code>__lt__</code> takes two parameters, <span><code>self</code></span> and <span><code>other</code></span>, and returns <span><code>True</code></span> if <span><code>self</code></span> is strictly less than <span><code>other</code></span>.</p>
<p>The correct ordering for cards is not obvious. For example, which is better, the 3 of Clubs or the 2 of Diamonds? One has a higher rank, but the other has a higher suit. In order to compare cards, you have to decide whether rank or suit is more important.</p>
<p>The answer might depend on what game you are playing, but to keep things simple, we’ll make the arbitrary choice that suit is more important, so all of the Spades outrank all of the Diamonds, and so on.</p>
<p>With that decided, we can write <code>__lt__</code>:</p>
<pre><code># inside class Card:

    def __lt__(self, other):
        # check the suits
        if self.suit &lt; other.suit: return True
        if self.suit &gt; other.suit: return False

        # suits are the same... check ranks
        return self.rank &lt; other.rank</code></pre>
<p>You can write this more concisely using tuple comparison:</p>
<pre><code># inside class Card:

    def __lt__(self, other):
        t1 = self.suit, self.rank
        t2 = other.suit, other.rank
        return t1 &lt; t2</code></pre>
<p>As an exercise, write an <code>__lt__</code> method for Time objects. You can use tuple comparison, but you also might consider comparing integers.</p>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>Decks</span></p>
<p>Now that we have Cards, the next step is to define Decks. Since a deck is made up of cards, it is natural for each Deck to contain a list of cards as an attribute.</p>
<p>The following is a class definition for <span><code>Deck</code></span>. The init method creates the attribute <span><code>cards</code></span> and generates the standard set of fifty-two cards:</p>
<pre><code>class Deck:

    def __init__(self):
        self.cards = []
        for suit in range(4):
            for rank in range(1, 14):
                card = Card(suit, rank)
                self.cards.append(card)</code></pre>
<p>The easiest way to populate the deck is with a nested loop. The outer loop enumerates the suits from 0 to 3. The inner loop enumerates the ranks from 1 to 13. Each iteration creates a new Card with the current suit and rank, and appends it to <span><code>self.cards</code></span>.</p>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>Printing the deck</span> <span id="printdeck" label="printdeck">[printdeck]</span></p>
<p>Here is a <code>__str__</code> method for <span><code>Deck</code></span>:</p>
<pre><code>#inside class Deck:

    def __str__(self):
        res = []
        for card in self.cards:
            res.append(str(card))
        return &#39;\n&#39;.join(res)</code></pre>
<p>This method demonstrates an efficient way to accumulate a large string: building a list of strings and then using the string method <span><code>join</code></span>. The built-in function <span><code>str</code></span> invokes the <code>__str__</code> method on each card and returns the string representation.</p>
<p>Since we invoke <span><code>join</code></span> on a newline character, the cards are separated by newlines. Here’s what the result looks like:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; deck = Deck()
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(deck)
Ace of Clubs
2 of Clubs
3 of Clubs
...
10 of Spades
Jack of Spades
Queen of Spades
King of Spades</code></pre>
<p>Even though the result appears on 52 lines, it is one long string that contains newlines.</p>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>Add, remove, shuffle and sort</span></p>
<p>To deal cards, we would like a method that removes a card from the deck and returns it. The list method <span><code>pop</code></span> provides a convenient way to do that:</p>
<pre><code>#inside class Deck:

    def pop_card(self):
        return self.cards.pop()</code></pre>
<p>Since <span><code>pop</code></span> removes the <span><em>last</em></span> card in the list, we are dealing from the bottom of the deck.</p>
<p>To add a card, we can use the list method <span><code>append</code></span>:</p>
<pre><code>#inside class Deck:

    def add_card(self, card):
        self.cards.append(card)</code></pre>
<p>A method like this that uses another method without doing much work is sometimes called a <span><strong>veneer</strong></span>. The metaphor comes from woodworking, where a veneer is a thin layer of good quality wood glued to the surface of a cheaper piece of wood to improve the appearance.</p>
<p>In this case <code>add_card</code> is a “thin” method that expresses a list operation in terms appropriate for decks. It improves the appearance, or interface, of the implementation.</p>
<p>As another example, we can write a Deck method named <span><code>shuffle</code></span> using the function <span><code>shuffle</code></span> from the <span><code>random</code></span> module:</p>
<pre><code># inside class Deck:
            
    def shuffle(self):
        random.shuffle(self.cards)</code></pre>
<p>Don’t forget to import <span><code>random</code></span>.</p>
<p>As an exercise, write a Deck method named <span><code>sort</code></span> that uses the list method <span><code>sort</code></span> to sort the cards in a <span><code>Deck</code></span>. <span><code>sort</code></span> uses the <code>__lt__</code> method we defined to determine the order.</p>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>Inheritance</span></p>
<p>Inheritance is the ability to define a new class that is a modified version of an existing class. As an example, let’s say we want a class to represent a “hand”, that is, the cards held by one player. A hand is similar to a deck: both are made up of a collection of cards, and both require operations like adding and removing cards.</p>
<p>A hand is also different from a deck; there are operations we want for hands that don’t make sense for a deck. For example, in poker we might compare two hands to see which one wins. In bridge, we might compute a score for a hand in order to make a bid.</p>
<p>This relationship between classes—similar, but different—lends itself to inheritance. To define a new class that inherits from an existing class, you put the name of the existing class in parentheses:</p>
<pre><code>class Hand(Deck):
    &quot;&quot;&quot;Represents a hand of playing cards.&quot;&quot;&quot;</code></pre>
<p>This definition indicates that <span><code>Hand</code></span> inherits from <span><code>Deck</code></span>; that means we can use methods like <code>pop_card</code> and <code>add_card</code> for Hands as well as Decks.</p>
<p>When a new class inherits from an existing one, the existing one is called the <span><strong>parent</strong></span> and the new class is called the <span><strong>child</strong></span>.</p>
<p>In this example, <span><code>Hand</code></span> inherits <code>__init__</code> from <span><code>Deck</code></span>, but it doesn’t really do what we want: instead of populating the hand with 52 new cards, the init method for Hands should initialize <span><code> cards</code></span> with an empty list.</p>
<p>If we provide an init method in the <span><code>Hand</code></span> class, it overrides the one in the <span><code>Deck</code></span> class:</p>
<pre><code># inside class Hand:

    def __init__(self, label=&#39;&#39;):
        self.cards = []
        self.label = label</code></pre>
<p>When you create a Hand, Python invokes this init method, not the one in <span><code>Deck</code></span>.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; hand = Hand(&#39;new hand&#39;)
&gt;&gt;&gt; hand.cards
[]
&gt;&gt;&gt; hand.label
&#39;new hand&#39;</code></pre>
<p>The other methods are inherited from <span><code>Deck</code></span>, so we can use <code>pop_card</code> and <code>add_card</code> to deal a card:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; deck = Deck()
&gt;&gt;&gt; card = deck.pop_card()
&gt;&gt;&gt; hand.add_card(card)
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(hand)
King of Spades</code></pre>
<p>A natural next step is to encapsulate this code in a method called <code>move_cards</code>:</p>
<pre><code>#inside class Deck:

    def move_cards(self, hand, num):
        for i in range(num):
            hand.add_card(self.pop_card())</code></pre>
<p><code>move_cards</code> takes two arguments, a Hand object and the number of cards to deal. It modifies both <span><code>self</code></span> and <span><code>hand</code></span>, and returns <span><code>None</code></span>.</p>
<p>In some games, cards are moved from one hand to another, or from a hand back to the deck. You can use <code>move_cards</code> for any of these operations: <span><code>self</code></span> can be either a Deck or a Hand, and <span><code>hand</code></span>, despite the name, can also be a <span><code>Deck</code></span>.</p>
<p>Inheritance is a useful feature. Some programs that would be repetitive without inheritance can be written more elegantly with it. Inheritance can facilitate code reuse, since you can customize the behavior of parent classes without having to modify them. In some cases, the inheritance structure reflects the natural structure of the problem, which makes the design easier to understand.</p>
<p>On the other hand, inheritance can make programs difficult to read. When a method is invoked, it is sometimes not clear where to find its definition. The relevant code may be spread across several modules. Also, many of the things that can be done using inheritance can be done as well or better without it.</p>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>Class diagrams</span> <span id="class.diagram" label="class.diagram">[class.diagram]</span></p>
<p>So far we have seen stack diagrams, which show the state of a program, and object diagrams, which show the attributes of an object and their values. These diagrams represent a snapshot in the execution of a program, so they change as the program runs.</p>
<p>They are also highly detailed; for some purposes, too detailed. A class diagram is a more abstract representation of the structure of a program. Instead of showing individual objects, it shows classes and the relationships between them.</p>
<p>There are several kinds of relationship between classes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Objects in one class might contain references to objects in another class. For example, each Rectangle contains a reference to a Point, and each Deck contains references to many Cards. This kind of relationship is called <span><strong>HAS-A</strong></span>, as in, “a Rectangle has a Point.”</p></li>
<li><p>One class might inherit from another. This relationship is called <span><strong>IS-A</strong></span>, as in, “a Hand is a kind of a Deck.”</p></li>
<li><p>One class might depend on another in the sense that objects in one class take objects in the second class as parameters, or use objects in the second class as part of a computation. This kind of relationship is called a <span><strong>dependency</strong></span>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>A <span><strong>class diagram</strong></span> is a graphical representation of these relationships. For example, Figure <a href="#fig.class1" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig.class1">19.2</a> shows the relationships between <span><code>Card</code></span>, <span><code>Deck</code></span> and <span><code>Hand</code></span>.</p>
<figure>
<embed src="figs/class1.pdf" id="fig.class1" /><figcaption>Class diagram.<span label="fig.class1"></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The arrow with a hollow triangle head represents an IS-A relationship; in this case it indicates that Hand inherits from Deck.</p>
<p>The standard arrow head represents a HAS-A relationship; in this case a Deck has references to Card objects.</p>
<p>The star (<span><code></code></span>) near the arrow head is a <span><strong>multiplicity</strong></span>; it indicates how many Cards a Deck has. A multiplicity can be a simple number, like <span><code>52</code></span>, a range, like <span><code>5..7</code></span> or a star, which indicates that a Deck can have any number of Cards.</p>
<p>There are no dependencies in this diagram. They would normally be shown with a dashed arrow. Or if there are a lot of dependencies, they are sometimes omitted.</p>
<p>A more detailed diagram might show that a Deck actually contains a <span><em>list</em></span> of Cards, but built-in types like list and dict are usually not included in class diagrams.</p>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>Debugging</span></p>
<p>Inheritance can make debugging difficult because when you invoke a method on an object, it might be hard to figure out which method will be invoked.</p>
<p>Suppose you are writing a function that works with Hand objects. You would like it to work with all kinds of Hands, like PokerHands, BridgeHands, etc. If you invoke a method like <span><code>shuffle</code></span>, you might get the one defined in <span><code>Deck</code></span>, but if any of the subclasses override this method, you’ll get that version instead. This behavior is usually a good thing, but it can be confusing.</p>
<p>Any time you are unsure about the flow of execution through your program, the simplest solution is to add print statements at the beginning of the relevant methods. If <span><code>Deck.shuffle</code></span> prints a message that says something like <span><code>Running Deck.shuffle</code></span>, then as the program runs it traces the flow of execution.</p>
<p>As an alternative, you could use this function, which takes an object and a method name (as a string) and returns the class that provides the definition of the method:</p>
<pre><code>def find_defining_class(obj, meth_name):
    for ty in type(obj).mro():
        if meth_name in ty.__dict__:
            return ty</code></pre>
<p>Here’s an example:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; hand = Hand()
&gt;&gt;&gt; find_defining_class(hand, &#39;shuffle&#39;)
&lt;class &#39;__main__.Deck&#39;&gt;</code></pre>
<p>So the <span><code>shuffle</code></span> method for this Hand is the one in <span><code>Deck</code></span>.</p>
<p><code>find_defining_class</code> uses the <span><code>mro</code></span> method to get the list of class objects (types) that will be searched for methods. “MRO” stands for “method resolution order”, which is the sequence of classes Python searches to “resolve” a method name.</p>
<p>Here’s a design suggestion: when you override a method, the interface of the new method should be the same as the old. It should take the same parameters, return the same type, and obey the same preconditions and postconditions. If you follow this rule, you will find that any function designed to work with an instance of a parent class, like a Deck, will also work with instances of child classes like a Hand and PokerHand.</p>
<p>If you violate this rule, which is called the “Liskov substitution principle”, your code will collapse like (sorry) a house of cards.</p>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>Data encapsulation</span></p>
<p>The previous chapters demonstrate a development plan we might call “object-oriented design”. We identified objects we needed—like <span><code>Point</code></span>, <span><code>Rectangle</code></span> and <span><code>Time</code></span>—and defined classes to represent them. In each case there is an obvious correspondence between the object and some entity in the real world (or at least a mathematical world).</p>
<p>But sometimes it is less obvious what objects you need and how they should interact. In that case you need a different development plan. In the same way that we discovered function interfaces by encapsulation and generalization, we can discover class interfaces by <span><strong>data encapsulation</strong></span>.</p>
<p>Markov analysis, from Section <a href="#markov" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="markov">[markov]</a>, provides a good example. If you download my code from <a href="http://thinkpython2.com/code/markov.py">http://thinkpython2.com/code/markov.py</a>, you’ll see that it uses two global variables—<code>suffix_map</code> and <code>prefix</code>—that are read and written from several functions.</p>
<pre><code>suffix_map = {}        
prefix = ()            </code></pre>
<p>Because these variables are global, we can only run one analysis at a time. If we read two texts, their prefixes and suffixes would be added to the same data structures (which makes for some interesting generated text).</p>
<p>To run multiple analyses, and keep them separate, we can encapsulate the state of each analysis in an object. Here’s what that looks like:</p>
<pre><code>class Markov:

    def __init__(self):
        self.suffix_map = {}
        self.prefix = ()    </code></pre>
<p>Next, we transform the functions into methods. For example, here’s <code>process_word</code>:</p>
<pre><code>    def process_word(self, word, order=2):
        if len(self.prefix) &lt; order:
            self.prefix += (word,)
            return

        try:
            self.suffix_map[self.prefix].append(word)
        except KeyError:
            # if there is no entry for this prefix, make one
            self.suffix_map[self.prefix] = [word]

        self.prefix = shift(self.prefix, word)        </code></pre>
<p>Transforming a program like this—changing the design without changing the behavior—is another example of refactoring (see Section <a href="#refactoring" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="refactoring">[refactoring]</a>).</p>
<p>This example suggests a development plan for designing objects and methods:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Start by writing functions that read and write global variables (when necessary).</p></li>
<li><p>Once you get the program working, look for associations between global variables and the functions that use them.</p></li>
<li><p>Encapsulate related variables as attributes of an object.</p></li>
<li><p>Transform the associated functions into methods of the new class.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>As an exercise, download my Markov code from <a href="http://thinkpython2.com/code/markov.py">http://thinkpython2.com/code/markov.py</a>, and follow the steps described above to encapsulate the global variables as attributes of a new class called <span><code>Markov</code></span>.

<h1 id="the-goodies">The Goodies</h1>
<p>One of my goals for this book has been to teach you as little Python as possible. When there were two ways to do something, I picked one and avoided mentioning the other. Or sometimes I put the second one into an exercise.</p>
<p>Now I want to go back for some of the good bits that got left behind. Python provides a number of features that are not really necessary—you can write good code without them—but with them you can sometimes write code that’s more concise, readable or efficient, and sometimes all three.</p>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>Conditional expressions</span></p>
<p>We saw conditional statements in Section <a href="#conditional.execution" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="conditional.execution">[conditional.execution]</a>. Conditional statements are often used to choose one of two values; for example:</p>
<pre><code>if x &gt; 0:
    y = math.log(x)
else:
    y = float(&#39;nan&#39;)</code></pre>
<p>This statement checks whether <span><code>x</code></span> is positive. If so, it computes <span><code>math.log</code></span>. If not, <span><code>math.log</code></span> would raise a ValueError. To avoid stopping the program, we generate a “NaN”, which is a special floating-point value that represents “Not a Number”.</p>
<p>We can write this statement more concisely using a <span><strong>conditional expression</strong></span>:</p>
<pre><code>y = math.log(x) if x &gt; 0 else float(&#39;nan&#39;)</code></pre>
<p>You can almost read this line like English: “<span><code>y</code></span> gets log-<span><code>x</code></span> if <span><code>x</code></span> is greater than 0; otherwise it gets NaN”.</p>
<p>Recursive functions can sometimes be rewritten using conditional expressions. For example, here is a recursive version of <span><code>factorial</code></span>:</p>
<pre><code>def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)</code></pre>
<p>We can rewrite it like this:</p>
<pre><code>def factorial(n):
    return 1 if n == 0 else n * factorial(n-1)</code></pre>
<p>Another use of conditional expressions is handling optional arguments. For example, here is the init method from <span><code>GoodKangaroo</code></span> (see Exercise <a href="#kangaroo" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="kangaroo">[kangaroo]</a>):</p>
<pre><code>    def __init__(self, name, contents=None):
        self.name = name
        if contents == None:
            contents = []
        self.pouch_contents = contents</code></pre>
<p>We can rewrite this one like this:</p>
<pre><code>    def __init__(self, name, contents=None):
        self.name = name
        self.pouch_contents = [] if contents == None else contents </code></pre>
<p>In general, you can replace a conditional statement with a conditional expression if both branches contain simple expressions that are either returned or assigned to the same variable.</p>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>List comprehensions</span></p>
<p>In Section <a href="#filter" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="filter">[filter]</a> we saw the map and filter patterns. For example, this function takes a list of strings, maps the string method <span><code>capitalize</code></span> to the elements, and returns a new list of strings:</p>
<pre><code>def capitalize_all(t):
    res = []
    for s in t:
        res.append(s.capitalize())
    return res</code></pre>
<p>We can write this more concisely using a <span><strong>list comprehension</strong></span>:</p>
<pre><code>def capitalize_all(t):
    return [s.capitalize() for s in t]</code></pre>
<p>The bracket operators indicate that we are constructing a new list. The expression inside the brackets specifies the elements of the list, and the <span><code>for</code></span> clause indicates what sequence we are traversing.</p>
<p>The syntax of a list comprehension is a little awkward because the loop variable, <span><code>s</code></span> in this example, appears in the expression before we get to the definition.</p>
<p>List comprehensions can also be used for filtering. For example, this function selects only the elements of <span><code>t</code></span> that are upper case, and returns a new list:</p>
<pre><code>def only_upper(t):
    res = []
    for s in t:
        if s.isupper():
            res.append(s)
    return res</code></pre>
<p>We can rewrite it using a list comprehension</p>
<pre><code>def only_upper(t):
    return [s for s in t if s.isupper()]</code></pre>
<p>List comprehensions are concise and easy to read, at least for simple expressions. And they are usually faster than the equivalent for loops, sometimes much faster. So if you are mad at me for not mentioning them earlier, I understand.</p>
<p>But, in my defense, list comprehensions are harder to debug because you can’t put a print statement inside the loop. I suggest that you use them only if the computation is simple enough that you are likely to get it right the first time. And for beginners that means never.</p>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>Generator expressions</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Generator expressions</strong></span> are similar to list comprehensions, but with parentheses instead of square brackets:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; g = (x**2 for x in range(5))
&gt;&gt;&gt; g
&lt;generator object &lt;genexpr&gt; at 0x7f4c45a786c0&gt;</code></pre>
<p>The result is a generator object that knows how to iterate through a sequence of values. But unlike a list comprehension, it does not compute the values all at once; it waits to be asked. The built-in function <span><code>next</code></span> gets the next value from the generator:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; next(g)
0
&gt;&gt;&gt; next(g)
1</code></pre>
<p>When you get to the end of the sequence, <span><code>next</code></span> raises a StopIteration exception. You can also use a <span><code>for</code></span> loop to iterate through the values:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; for val in g:
...     print(val)
4
9
16</code></pre>
<p>The generator object keeps track of where it is in the sequence, so the <span><code>for</code></span> loop picks up where <span><code>next</code></span> left off. Once the generator is exhausted, it continues to raise <span><code>StopIteration</code></span>:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; next(g)
StopIteration</code></pre>
<p>Generator expressions are often used with functions like <span><code>sum</code></span>, <span><code>max</code></span>, and <span><code>min</code></span>:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; sum(x**2 for x in range(5))
30</code></pre>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span><span><code>any</code></span> and <span><code>all</code></span></span></p>
<p>Python provides a built-in function, <span><code>any</code></span>, that takes a sequence of boolean values and returns <span><code>True</code></span> if any of the values are <span><code> True</code></span>. It works on lists:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; any([False, False, True])
True</code></pre>
<p>But it is often used with generator expressions:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; any(letter == &#39;t&#39; for letter in &#39;monty&#39;)
True</code></pre>
<p>That example isn’t very useful because it does the same thing as the <span><code>in</code></span> operator. But we could use <span><code>any</code></span> to rewrite some of the search functions we wrote in Section <a href="#search" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="search">[search]</a>. For example, we could write <span><code>avoids</code></span> like this:</p>
<pre><code>def avoids(word, forbidden):
    return not any(letter in forbidden for letter in word)</code></pre>
<p>The function almost reads like English, “<span><code>word</code></span> avoids <span><code>forbidden</code></span> if there are not any forbidden letters in <span><code>word</code></span>.”</p>
<p>Using <span><code>any</code></span> with a generator expression is efficient because it stops immediately if it finds a <span><code>True</code></span> value, so it doesn’t have to evaluate the whole sequence.</p>
<p>Python provides another built-in function, <span><code>all</code></span>, that returns <span><code>True</code></span> if every element of the sequence is <span><code>True</code></span>. As an exercise, use <span><code>all</code></span> to re-write <code>uses_all</code> from Section <a href="#search" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="search">[search]</a>.</p>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>Sets</span> <span id="sets" label="sets">[sets]</span></p>
<p>In Section <a href="#dictsub" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="dictsub">[dictsub]</a> I use dictionaries to find the words that appear in a document but not in a word list. The function I wrote takes <span><code>d1</code></span>, which contains the words from the document as keys, and <span><code>d2</code></span>, which contains the list of words. It returns a dictionary that contains the keys from <span><code>d1</code></span> that are not in <span><code>d2</code></span>.</p>
<pre><code>def subtract(d1, d2):
    res = dict()
    for key in d1:
        if key not in d2:
            res[key] = None
    return res</code></pre>
<p>In all of these dictionaries, the values are <span><code>None</code></span> because we never use them. As a result, we waste some storage space.</p>
<p>Python provides another built-in type, called a <span><code>set</code></span>, that behaves like a collection of dictionary keys with no values. Adding elements to a set is fast; so is checking membership. And sets provide methods and operators to compute common set operations.</p>
<p>For example, set subtraction is available as a method called <span><code>difference</code></span> or as an operator, <span><code>-</code></span>. So we can rewrite <span><code>subtract</code></span> like this:</p>
<pre><code>def subtract(d1, d2):
    return set(d1) - set(d2)</code></pre>
<p>The result is a set instead of a dictionary, but for operations like iteration, the behavior is the same.</p>
<p>Some of the exercises in this book can be done concisely and efficiently with sets. For example, here is a solution to <code>has_duplicates</code>, from Exercise <a href="#duplicate" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="duplicate">[duplicate]</a>, that uses a dictionary:</p>
<pre><code>def has_duplicates(t):
    d = {}
    for x in t:
        if x in d:
            return True
        d[x] = True
    return False</code></pre>
<p>When an element appears for the first time, it is added to the dictionary. If the same element appears again, the function returns <span><code>True</code></span>.</p>
<p>Using sets, we can write the same function like this:</p>
<pre><code>def has_duplicates(t):
    return len(set(t)) &lt; len(t)</code></pre>
<p>An element can only appear in a set once, so if an element in <span><code>t</code></span> appears more than once, the set will be smaller than <span><code>t</code></span>. If there are no duplicates, the set will be the same size as <span><code>t</code></span>.</p>
<p>We can also use sets to do some of the exercises in Chapter <a href="#wordplay" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="wordplay">10</a>. For example, here’s a version of <code>uses_only</code> with a loop:</p>
<pre><code>def uses_only(word, available):
    for letter in word: 
        if letter not in available:
            return False
    return True</code></pre>
<p><code>uses_only</code> checks whether all letters in <span><code>word</code></span> are in <span><code>available</code></span>. We can rewrite it like this:</p>
<pre><code>def uses_only(word, available):
    return set(word) &lt;= set(available)</code></pre>
<p>The <code>&lt;=</code> operator checks whether one set is a subset of another, including the possibility that they are equal, which is true if all the letters in <span><code>word</code></span> appear in <span><code>available</code></span>.</p>
<p>As an exercise, rewrite <code>avoids</code> using sets.</p>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>Counters</span></p>
<p>A Counter is like a set, except that if an element appears more than once, the Counter keeps track of how many times it appears. If you are familiar with the mathematical idea of a <span><strong>multiset</strong></span>, a Counter is a natural way to represent a multiset.</p>
<p>Counter is defined in a standard module called <span><code>collections</code></span>, so you have to import it. You can initialize a Counter with a string, list, or anything else that supports iteration:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; from collections import Counter
&gt;&gt;&gt; count = Counter(&#39;parrot&#39;)
&gt;&gt;&gt; count
Counter({&#39;r&#39;: 2, &#39;t&#39;: 1, &#39;o&#39;: 1, &#39;p&#39;: 1, &#39;a&#39;: 1})</code></pre>
<p>Counters behave like dictionaries in many ways; they map from each key to the number of times it appears. As in dictionaries, the keys have to be hashable.</p>
<p>Unlike dictionaries, Counters don’t raise an exception if you access an element that doesn’t appear. Instead, they return 0:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; count[&#39;d&#39;]
0</code></pre>
<p>We can use Counters to rewrite <code>is_anagram</code> from Exercise <a href="#anagram" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="anagram">[anagram]</a>:</p>
<pre><code>def is_anagram(word1, word2):
    return Counter(word1) == Counter(word2)</code></pre>
<p>If two words are anagrams, they contain the same letters with the same counts, so their Counters are equivalent.</p>
<p>Counters provide methods and operators to perform set-like operations, including addition, subtraction, union and intersection. And they provide an often-useful method, <code>most_common</code>, which returns a list of value-frequency pairs, sorted from most common to least:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; count = Counter(&#39;parrot&#39;)
&gt;&gt;&gt; for val, freq in count.most_common(3):
...     print(val, freq)
r 2
p 1
a 1</code></pre>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>defaultdict</span></p>
<p>The <span><code>collections</code></span> module also provides <span><code>defaultdict</code></span>, which is like a dictionary except that if you access a key that doesn’t exist, it can generate a new value on the fly.</p>
<p>When you create a defaultdict, you provide a function that’s used to create new values. A function used to create objects is sometimes called a <span><strong>factory</strong></span>. The built-in functions that create lists, sets, and other types can be used as factories:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; from collections import defaultdict
&gt;&gt;&gt; d = defaultdict(list)</code></pre>
<p>Notice that the argument is <span><code>list</code></span>, which is a class object, not <span><code>list()</code></span>, which is a new list. The function you provide doesn’t get called unless you access a key that doesn’t exist.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; t = d[&#39;new key&#39;]
&gt;&gt;&gt; t
[]</code></pre>
<p>The new list, which we’re calling <span><code>t</code></span>, is also added to the dictionary. So if we modify <span><code>t</code></span>, the change appears in <span><code>d</code></span>:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; t.append(&#39;new value&#39;)
&gt;&gt;&gt; d
defaultdict(&lt;class &#39;list&#39;&gt;, {&#39;new key&#39;: [&#39;new value&#39;]})</code></pre>
<p>If you are making a dictionary of lists, you can often write simpler code using <span><code>defaultdict</code></span>. In my solution to Exercise <a href="#anagrams" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="anagrams">[anagrams]</a>, which you can get from <a href="http://thinkpython2.com/code/anagram_sets.py">http://thinkpython2.com/code/anagram_sets.py</a>, I make a dictionary that maps from a sorted string of letters to the list of words that can be spelled with those letters. For example, <span><code> ’opst’</code></span> maps to the list <span><code>[’opts’, ’post’, ’pots’, ’spot’, ’stop’, ’tops’]</code></span>.</p>
<p>Here’s the original code:</p>
<pre><code>def all_anagrams(filename):
    d = {}
    for line in open(filename):
        word = line.strip().lower()
        t = signature(word)
        if t not in d:
            d[t] = [word]
        else:
            d[t].append(word)
    return d</code></pre>
<p>This can be simplified using <span><code>setdefault</code></span>, which you might have used in Exercise <a href="#setdefault" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="setdefault">[setdefault]</a>:</p>
<pre><code>def all_anagrams(filename):
    d = {}
    for line in open(filename):
        word = line.strip().lower()
        t = signature(word)
        d.setdefault(t, []).append(word)
    return d</code></pre>
<p>This solution has the drawback that it makes a new list every time, regardless of whether it is needed. For lists, that’s no big deal, but if the factory function is complicated, it might be.</p>
<p>We can avoid this problem and simplify the code using a <span><code>defaultdict</code></span>:</p>
<pre><code>def all_anagrams(filename):
    d = defaultdict(list)
    for line in open(filename):
        word = line.strip().lower()
        t = signature(word)
        d[t].append(word)
    return d</code></pre>
<p>My solution to Exercise <a href="#poker" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="poker">[poker]</a>, which you can download from <a href="http://thinkpython2.com/code/PokerHandSoln.py">http://thinkpython2.com/code/PokerHandSoln.py</a>, uses <span><code>setdefault</code></span> in the function <code>has_straightflush</code>. This solution has the drawback of creating a <span><code>Hand</code></span> object every time through the loop, whether it is needed or not. As an exercise, rewrite it using a defaultdict.</p>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>Named tuples</span></p>
<p>Many simple objects are basically collections of related values. For example, the Point object defined in Chapter <a href="#clobjects" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="clobjects">16</a> contains two numbers, <span><code>x</code></span> and <span><code>y</code></span>. When you define a class like this, you usually start with an init method and a str method:</p>
<pre><code>class Point:

    def __init__(self, x=0, y=0):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y

    def __str__(self):
        return &#39;(%g, %g)&#39; % (self.x, self.y)</code></pre>
<p>This is a lot of code to convey a small amount of information. Python provides a more concise way to say the same thing:</p>
<pre><code>from collections import namedtuple
Point = namedtuple(&#39;Point&#39;, [&#39;x&#39;, &#39;y&#39;])</code></pre>
<p>The first argument is the name of the class you want to create. The second is a list of the attributes Point objects should have, as strings. The return value from <span><code>namedtuple</code></span> is a class object:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; Point
&lt;class &#39;__main__.Point&#39;&gt;</code></pre>
<p><span><code>Point</code></span> automatically provides methods like <code>__init__</code> and <code>__str__</code> so you don’t have to write them.</p>
<p>To create a Point object, you use the Point class as a function:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; p = Point(1, 2)
&gt;&gt;&gt; p
Point(x=1, y=2)</code></pre>
<p>The init method assigns the arguments to attributes using the names you provided. The str method prints a representation of the Point object and its attributes.</p>
<p>You can access the elements of the named tuple by name:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; p.x, p.y
(1, 2)</code></pre>
<p>But you can also treat a named tuple as a tuple:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; p[0], p[1]
(1, 2)

&gt;&gt;&gt; x, y = p
&gt;&gt;&gt; x, y
(1, 2)</code></pre>
<p>Named tuples provide a quick way to define simple classes. The drawback is that simple classes don’t always stay simple. You might decide later that you want to add methods to a named tuple. In that case, you could define a new class that inherits from the named tuple:</p>
<pre><code>class Pointier(Point):
    # add more methods here</code></pre>
<p>Or you could switch to a conventional class definition.</p>

<p>In Section <a href="#gather" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="gather">[gather]</a>, we saw how to write a function that gathers its arguments into a tuple:</p>
<pre><code>def printall(*args):
    print(args)</code></pre>
<p>You can call this function with any number of positional arguments (that is, arguments that don’t have keywords):</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; printall(1, 2.0, &#39;3&#39;)
(1, 2.0, &#39;3&#39;)</code></pre>
<p>But the <span><code></code></span> operator doesn’t gather keyword arguments:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; printall(1, 2.0, third=&#39;3&#39;)
TypeError: printall() got an unexpected keyword argument &#39;third&#39;</code></pre>
<p>To gather keyword arguments, you can use the <span><code>*</code></span> operator:</p>
<pre><code>def printall(*args, **kwargs):
    print(args, kwargs)</code></pre>
<p>You can call the keyword gathering parameter anything you want, but <span><code>kwargs</code></span> is a common choice. The result is a dictionary that maps keywords to values:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; printall(1, 2.0, third=&#39;3&#39;)
(1, 2.0) {&#39;third&#39;: &#39;3&#39;}</code></pre>
<p>If you have a dictionary of keywords and values, you can use the scatter operator, <span><code>*</code></span> to call a function:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; d = dict(x=1, y=2)
&gt;&gt;&gt; Point(**d)
Point(x=1, y=2)</code></pre>
<p>Without the scatter operator, the function would treat <span><code>d</code></span> as a single positional argument, so it would assign <span><code>d</code></span> to <span><code>x</code></span> and complain because there’s nothing to assign to <span><code>y</code></span>:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; d = dict(x=1, y=2)
&gt;&gt;&gt; Point(d)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File &quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;, line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
TypeError: __new__() missing 1 required positional argument: &#39;y&#39;</code></pre>
<p>When you are working with functions that have a large number of parameters, it is often useful to create and pass around dictionaries that specify frequently used options.</p>

<p>One note: this function is not very efficient because it ends up computing the same values over and over. You could make it more efficient by memoizing (see Section <a href="#memoize" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="memoize">[memoize]</a>). But you will find that it’s harder to memoize if you write it using conditional expressions.</p>
<h1 id="debugging">Debugging</h1>
<p>When you are debugging, you should distinguish among different kinds of errors in order to track them down more quickly:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Syntax errors are discovered by the interpreter when it is translating the source code into byte code. They indicate that there is something wrong with the structure of the program. Example: Omitting the colon at the end of a <span><code>def</code></span> statement generates the somewhat redundant message <span><code>SyntaxError: invalid syntax</code></span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Runtime errors are produced by the interpreter if something goes wrong while the program is running. Most runtime error messages include information about where the error occurred and what functions were executing. Example: An infinite recursion eventually causes the runtime error “maximum recursion depth exceeded”.</p></li>
<li><p>Semantic errors are problems with a program that runs without producing error messages but doesn’t do the right thing. Example: An expression may not be evaluated in the order you expect, yielding an incorrect result.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The first step in debugging is to figure out which kind of error you are dealing with. Although the following sections are organized by error type, some techniques are applicable in more than one situation.</p>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>Syntax errors</span></p>
<p>Syntax errors are usually easy to fix once you figure out what they are. Unfortunately, the error messages are often not helpful. The most common messages are <span><code>SyntaxError: invalid syntax</code></span> and <span><code>SyntaxError: invalid token</code></span>, neither of which is very informative.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the message does tell you where in the program the problem occurred. Actually, it tells you where Python noticed a problem, which is not necessarily where the error is. Sometimes the error is prior to the location of the error message, often on the preceding line.</p>
<p>If you are building the program incrementally, you should have a good idea about where the error is. It will be in the last line you added.</p>
<p>If you are copying code from a book, start by comparing your code to the book’s code very carefully. Check every character. At the same time, remember that the book might be wrong, so if you see something that looks like a syntax error, it might be.</p>
<p>Here are some ways to avoid the most common syntax errors:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Make sure you are not using a Python keyword for a variable name.</p></li>
<li><p>Check that you have a colon at the end of the header of every compound statement, including <span><code>for</code></span>, <span><code>while</code></span>, <span><code>if</code></span>, and <span><code>def</code></span> statements.</p></li>
<li><p>Make sure that any strings in the code have matching quotation marks. Make sure that all quotation marks are “straight quotes”, not “curly quotes”.</p></li>
<li><p>If you have multiline strings with triple quotes (single or double), make sure you have terminated the string properly. An unterminated string may cause an <span><code>invalid token</code></span> error at the end of your program, or it may treat the following part of the program as a string until it comes to the next string. In the second case, it might not produce an error message at all!</p></li>
<li><p>An unclosed opening operator—<code>(</code>, <code>{</code>, or <code>[</code>—makes Python continue with the next line as part of the current statement. Generally, an error occurs almost immediately in the next line.</p></li>
<li><p>Check for the classic <span><code>=</code></span> instead of <span><code>==</code></span> inside a conditional.</p></li>
<li><p>Check the indentation to make sure it lines up the way it is supposed to. Python can handle space and tabs, but if you mix them it can cause problems. The best way to avoid this problem is to use a text editor that knows about Python and generates consistent indentation.</p></li>
<li><p>If you have non-ASCII characters in the code (including strings and comments), that might cause a problem, although Python 3 usually handles non-ASCII characters. Be careful if you paste in text from a web page or other source.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>If nothing works, move on to the next section...</p>
<p><span>-3.25ex-1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.3ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>I keep making changes and it makes no difference.</span></p>
<p>If the interpreter says there is an error and you don’t see it, that might be because you and the interpreter are not looking at the same code. Check your programming environment to make sure that the program you are editing is the one Python is trying to run.</p>
<p>If you are not sure, try putting an obvious and deliberate syntax error at the beginning of the program. Now run it again. If the interpreter doesn’t find the new error, you are not running the new code.</p>
<p>There are a few likely culprits:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>You edited the file and forgot to save the changes before running it again. Some programming environments do this for you, but some don’t.</p></li>
<li><p>You changed the name of the file, but you are still running the old name.</p></li>
<li><p>Something in your development environment is configured incorrectly.</p></li>
<li><p>If you are writing a module and using <span><code>import</code></span>, make sure you don’t give your module the same name as one of the standard Python modules.</p></li>
<li><p>If you are using <span><code>import</code></span> to read a module, remember that you have to restart the interpreter or use <span><code>reload</code></span> to read a modified file. If you import the module again, it doesn’t do anything.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If you get stuck and you can’t figure out what is going on, one approach is to start again with a new program like “Hello, World!”, and make sure you can get a known program to run. Then gradually add the pieces of the original program to the new one.</p>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>Runtime errors</span></p>
<p>Once your program is syntactically correct, Python can read it and at least start running it. What could possibly go wrong?</p>
<p><span>-3.25ex-1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.3ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>My program does absolutely nothing.</span></p>
<p>This problem is most common when your file consists of functions and classes but does not actually invoke a function to start execution. This may be intentional if you only plan to import this module to supply classes and functions.</p>
<p>If it is not intentional, make sure there is a function call in the program, and make sure the flow of execution reaches it (see “Flow of Execution” below).</p>
<p><span>-3.25ex-1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.3ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>My program hangs.</span></p>
<p>If a program stops and seems to be doing nothing, it is “hanging”. Often that means that it is caught in an infinite loop or infinite recursion.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If there is a particular loop that you suspect is the problem, add a <span><code>print</code></span> statement immediately before the loop that says “entering the loop” and another immediately after that says “exiting the loop”.</p>
<p>Run the program. If you get the first message and not the second, you’ve got an infinite loop. Go to the “Infinite Loop” section below.</p></li>
<li><p>Most of the time, an infinite recursion will cause the program to run for a while and then produce a “RuntimeError: Maximum recursion depth exceeded” error. If that happens, go to the “Infinite Recursion” section below.</p>
<p>If you are not getting this error but you suspect there is a problem with a recursive method or function, you can still use the techniques in the “Infinite Recursion” section.</p></li>
<li><p>If neither of those steps works, start testing other loops and other recursive functions and methods.</p></li>
<li><p>If that doesn’t work, then it is possible that you don’t understand the flow of execution in your program. Go to the “Flow of Execution” section below.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><span>-3.25ex-1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.3ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>Infinite Loop</span></p>
<p>If you think you have an infinite loop and you think you know what loop is causing the problem, add a <span><code>print</code></span> statement at the end of the loop that prints the values of the variables in the condition and the value of the condition.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code>while x &gt; 0 and y &lt; 0 :
    # do something to x
    # do something to y

    print(&#39;x: &#39;, x)
    print(&#39;y: &#39;, y)
    print(&quot;condition: &quot;, (x &gt; 0 and y &lt; 0))</code></pre>
<p>Now when you run the program, you will see three lines of output for each time through the loop. The last time through the loop, the condition should be <span><code>False</code></span>. If the loop keeps going, you will be able to see the values of <span><code>x</code></span> and <span><code>y</code></span>, and you might figure out why they are not being updated correctly.</p>
<p><span>-3.25ex-1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.3ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>Infinite Recursion</span></p>
<p>Most of the time, infinite recursion causes the program to run for a while and then produce a <span><code>Maximum recursion depth exceeded</code></span> error.</p>
<p>If you suspect that a function is causing an infinite recursion, make sure that there is a base case. There should be some condition that causes the function to return without making a recursive invocation. If not, you need to rethink the algorithm and identify a base case.</p>
<p>If there is a base case but the program doesn’t seem to be reaching it, add a <span><code>print</code></span> statement at the beginning of the function that prints the parameters. Now when you run the program, you will see a few lines of output every time the function is invoked, and you will see the parameter values. If the parameters are not moving toward the base case, you will get some ideas about why not.</p>
<p><span>-3.25ex-1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.3ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>Flow of Execution</span></p>
<p>If you are not sure how the flow of execution is moving through your program, add <span><code>print</code></span> statements to the beginning of each function with a message like “entering function <span><code>foo</code></span>”, where <span><code>foo</code></span> is the name of the function.</p>
<p>Now when you run the program, it will print a trace of each function as it is invoked.</p>
<p><span>-3.25ex-1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.3ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>When I run the program I get an exception.</span></p>
<p>If something goes wrong during runtime, Python prints a message that includes the name of the exception, the line of the program where the problem occurred, and a traceback.</p>
<p>The traceback identifies the function that is currently running, and then the function that called it, and then the function that called <span><em>that</em></span>, and so on. In other words, it traces the sequence of function calls that got you to where you are, including the line number in your file where each call occurred.</p>
<p>The first step is to examine the place in the program where the error occurred and see if you can figure out what happened. These are some of the most common runtime errors:</p>
<dl>
<dt>NameError:</dt>
<dd><p>You are trying to use a variable that doesn’t exist in the current environment. Check if the name is spelled right, or at least consistently. And remember that local variables are local; you cannot refer to them from outside the function where they are defined.</p>
</dd>
<dt>TypeError:</dt>
<dd><p>There are several possible causes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>You are trying to use a value improperly. Example: indexing a string, list, or tuple with something other than an integer.</p></li>
<li><p>There is a mismatch between the items in a format string and the items passed for conversion. This can happen if either the number of items does not match or an invalid conversion is called for.</p></li>
<li><p>You are passing the wrong number of arguments to a function. For methods, look at the method definition and check that the first parameter is <span><code>self</code></span>. Then look at the method invocation; make sure you are invoking the method on an object with the right type and providing the other arguments correctly.</p></li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt>KeyError:</dt>
<dd><p>You are trying to access an element of a dictionary using a key that the dictionary does not contain. If the keys are strings, remember that capitalization matters.</p>
</dd>
<dt>AttributeError:</dt>
<dd><p>You are trying to access an attribute or method that does not exist. Check the spelling! You can use the built-in function <span><code>vars</code></span> to list the attributes that do exist.</p>
<p>If an AttributeError indicates that an object has <span><code>NoneType</code></span>, that means that it is <span><code>None</code></span>. So the problem is not the attribute name, but the object.</p>
<p>The reason the object is none might be that you forgot to return a value from a function; if you get to the end of a function without hitting a <span><code>return</code></span> statement, it returns <span><code>None</code></span>. Another common cause is using the result from a list method, like <span><code>sort</code></span>, that returns <span><code>None</code></span>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>IndexError:</dt>
<dd><p>The index you are using to access a list, string, or tuple is greater than its length minus one. Immediately before the site of the error, add a <span><code>print</code></span> statement to display the value of the index and the length of the array. Is the array the right size? Is the index the right value?</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The Python debugger (<span><code>pdb</code></span>) is useful for tracking down exceptions because it allows you to examine the state of the program immediately before the error. You can read about <span><code>pdb</code></span> at <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html">https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html</a>.</p>
<p><span>-3.25ex-1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.3ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>I added so many <span><code>print</code></span> statements I get inundated with output.</span></p>
<p>One of the problems with using <span><code>print</code></span> statements for debugging is that you can end up buried in output. There are two ways to proceed: simplify the output or simplify the program.</p>
<p>To simplify the output, you can remove or comment out <span><code>print</code></span> statements that aren’t helping, or combine them, or format the output so it is easier to understand.</p>
<p>To simplify the program, there are several things you can do. First, scale down the problem the program is working on. For example, if you are searching a list, search a <span><em>small</em></span> list. If the program takes input from the user, give it the simplest input that causes the problem.</p>
<p>Second, clean up the program. Remove dead code and reorganize the program to make it as easy to read as possible. For example, if you suspect that the problem is in a deeply nested part of the program, try rewriting that part with simpler structure. If you suspect a large function, try splitting it into smaller functions and testing them separately.</p>
<p>Often the process of finding the minimal test case leads you to the bug. If you find that a program works in one situation but not in another, that gives you a clue about what is going on.</p>
<p>Similarly, rewriting a piece of code can help you find subtle bugs. If you make a change that you think shouldn’t affect the program, and it does, that can tip you off.</p>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>Semantic errors</span></p>
<p>In some ways, semantic errors are the hardest to debug, because the interpreter provides no information about what is wrong. Only you know what the program is supposed to do.</p>
<p>The first step is to make a connection between the program text and the behavior you are seeing. You need a hypothesis about what the program is actually doing. One of the things that makes that hard is that computers run so fast.</p>
<p>You will often wish that you could slow the program down to human speed, and with some debuggers you can. But the time it takes to insert a few well-placed <span><code>print</code></span> statements is often short compared to setting up the debugger, inserting and removing breakpoints, and “stepping” the program to where the error is occurring.</p>
<p><span>-3.25ex-1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.3ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>My program doesn’t work.</span></p>
<p>You should ask yourself these questions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Is there something the program was supposed to do but which doesn’t seem to be happening? Find the section of the code that performs that function and make sure it is executing when you think it should.</p></li>
<li><p>Is something happening that shouldn’t? Find code in your program that performs that function and see if it is executing when it shouldn’t.</p></li>
<li><p>Is a section of code producing an effect that is not what you expected? Make sure that you understand the code in question, especially if it involves functions or methods in other Python modules. Read the documentation for the functions you call. Try them out by writing simple test cases and checking the results.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In order to program, you need a mental model of how programs work. If you write a program that doesn’t do what you expect, often the problem is not in the program; it’s in your mental model.</p>
<p>The best way to correct your mental model is to break the program into its components (usually the functions and methods) and test each component independently. Once you find the discrepancy between your model and reality, you can solve the problem.</p>
<p>Of course, you should be building and testing components as you develop the program. If you encounter a problem, there should be only a small amount of new code that is not known to be correct.</p>
<p><span>-3.25ex-1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.3ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>I’ve got a big hairy expression and it doesn’t do what I expect.</span></p>
<p>Writing complex expressions is fine as long as they are readable, but they can be hard to debug. It is often a good idea to break a complex expression into a series of assignments to temporary variables.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code>self.hands[i].addCard(self.hands[self.findNeighbor(i)].popCard())</code></pre>
<p>This can be rewritten as:</p>
<pre><code>neighbor = self.findNeighbor(i)
pickedCard = self.hands[neighbor].popCard()
self.hands[i].addCard(pickedCard)</code></pre>
<p>The explicit version is easier to read because the variable names provide additional documentation, and it is easier to debug because you can check the types of the intermediate variables and display their values.</p>
<p>Another problem that can occur with big expressions is that the order of evaluation may not be what you expect. For example, if you are translating the expression <span class="math inline">$\frac{x}{2 \pi}$</span> into Python, you might write:</p>
<pre><code>y = x / 2 * math.pi</code></pre>
<p>That is not correct because multiplication and division have the same precedence and are evaluated from left to right. So this expression computes <span class="math inline"><em>x</em><em>π</em>/2</span>.</p>
<p>A good way to debug expressions is to add parentheses to make the order of evaluation explicit:</p>
<pre><code> y = x / (2 * math.pi)</code></pre>
<p>Whenever you are not sure of the order of evaluation, use parentheses. Not only will the program be correct (in the sense of doing what you intended), it will also be more readable for other people who haven’t memorized the order of operations.</p>
<p><span>-3.25ex-1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.3ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>I’ve got a function that doesn’t return what I expect.</span></p>
<p>If you have a <span><code>return</code></span> statement with a complex expression, you don’t have a chance to print the result before returning. Again, you can use a temporary variable. For example, instead of:</p>
<pre><code>return self.hands[i].removeMatches()</code></pre>
<p>you could write:</p>
<pre><code>count = self.hands[i].removeMatches()
return count</code></pre>
<p>Now you have the opportunity to display the value of <span><code>count</code></span> before returning.</p>
<p><span>-3.25ex-1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.3ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>I’m really, really stuck and I need help.</span></p>
<p>First, try getting away from the computer for a few minutes. Computers emit waves that affect the brain, causing these symptoms:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Frustration and rage.</p></li>
<li><p>Superstitious beliefs (“the computer hates me”) and magical thinking (“the program only works when I wear my hat backward”).</p></li>
<li><p>Random walk programming (the attempt to program by writing every possible program and choosing the one that does the right thing).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If you find yourself suffering from any of these symptoms, get up and go for a walk. When you are calm, think about the program. What is it doing? What are some possible causes of that behavior? When was the last time you had a working program, and what did you do next?</p>
<p>Sometimes it just takes time to find a bug. I often find bugs when I am away from the computer and let my mind wander. Some of the best places to find bugs are trains, showers, and in bed, just before you fall asleep.</p>
<p><span>-3.25ex-1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.3ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>No, I really need help.</span></p>
<p>It happens. Even the best programmers occasionally get stuck. Sometimes you work on a program so long that you can’t see the error. You need a fresh pair of eyes.</p>
<p>Before you bring someone else in, make sure you are prepared. Your program should be as simple as possible, and you should be working on the smallest input that causes the error. You should have <span><code>print</code></span> statements in the appropriate places (and the output they produce should be comprehensible). You should understand the problem well enough to describe it concisely.</p>
<p>When you bring someone in to help, be sure to give them the information they need:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If there is an error message, what is it and what part of the program does it indicate?</p></li>
<li><p>What was the last thing you did before this error occurred? What were the last lines of code that you wrote, or what is the new test case that fails?</p></li>
<li><p>What have you tried so far, and what have you learned?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>When you find the bug, take a second to think about what you could have done to find it faster. Next time you see something similar, you will be able to find the bug more quickly.</p>
<p>Remember, the goal is not just to make the program work. The goal is to learn how to make the program work.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This appendix is an edited excerpt from <span><em>Think Complexity</em></span>, by Allen B. Downey, also published by O’Reilly Media (2012). When you are done with this book, you might want to move on to that one.</p>

<p><span><strong>Analysis of algorithms</strong></span> is a branch of computer science that studies the performance of algorithms, especially their run time and space requirements. See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_algorithms">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_algorithms</a>.</p>
<p>The practical goal of algorithm analysis is to predict the performance of different algorithms in order to guide design decisions.</p>
<p>During the 2008 United States Presidential Campaign, candidate Barack Obama was asked to perform an impromptu analysis when he visited Google. Chief executive Eric Schmidt jokingly asked him for “the most efficient way to sort a million 32-bit integers.” Obama had apparently been tipped off, because he quickly replied, “I think the bubble sort would be the wrong way to go.” See <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4RRi_ntQc8">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4RRi_ntQc8</a>.</p>
<p>This is true: bubble sort is conceptually simple but slow for large datasets. The answer Schmidt was probably looking for is “radix sort” (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radix_sort">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radix_sort</a>)<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>.</p>
<p>The goal of algorithm analysis is to make meaningful comparisons between algorithms, but there are some problems:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The relative performance of the algorithms might depend on characteristics of the hardware, so one algorithm might be faster on Machine A, another on Machine B. The general solution to this problem is to specify a <span><strong>machine model</strong></span> and analyze the number of steps, or operations, an algorithm requires under a given model.</p></li>
<li><p>Relative performance might depend on the details of the dataset. For example, some sorting algorithms run faster if the data are already partially sorted; other algorithms run slower in this case. A common way to avoid this problem is to analyze the <span><strong>worst case</strong></span> scenario. It is sometimes useful to analyze average case performance, but that’s usually harder, and it might not be obvious what set of cases to average over.</p></li>
<li><p>Relative performance also depends on the size of the problem. A sorting algorithm that is fast for small lists might be slow for long lists. The usual solution to this problem is to express run time (or number of operations) as a function of problem size, and group functions into categories depending on how quickly they grow as problem size increases.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The good thing about this kind of comparison is that it lends itself to simple classification of algorithms. For example, if I know that the run time of Algorithm A tends to be proportional to the size of the input, <span class="math inline"><em>n</em></span>, and Algorithm B tends to be proportional to <span class="math inline"><em>n</em><sup>2</sup></span>, then I expect A to be faster than B, at least for large values of <span class="math inline"><em>n</em></span>.</p>
<p>This kind of analysis comes with some caveats, but we’ll get to that later.</p>

<p>Suppose you have analyzed two algorithms and expressed their run times in terms of the size of the input: Algorithm A takes <span class="math inline">100<em>n</em> + 1</span> steps to solve a problem with size <span class="math inline"><em>n</em></span>; Algorithm B takes <span class="math inline"><em>n</em><sup>2</sup> + <em>n</em> + 1</span> steps.</p>
<p>The following table shows the run time of these algorithms for different problem sizes:</p>

<p>At <span class="math inline"><em>n</em> = 10</span>, Algorithm A looks pretty bad; it takes almost 10 times longer than Algorithm B. But for <span class="math inline"><em>n</em> = 100</span> they are about the same, and for larger values A is much better.</p>
<p>The fundamental reason is that for large values of <span class="math inline"><em>n</em></span>, any function that contains an <span class="math inline"><em>n</em><sup>2</sup></span> term will grow faster than a function whose leading term is <span class="math inline"><em>n</em></span>. The <span><strong>leading term</strong></span> is the term with the highest exponent.</p>
<p>For Algorithm A, the leading term has a large coefficient, 100, which is why B does better than A for small <span class="math inline"><em>n</em></span>. But regardless of the coefficients, there will always be some value of <span class="math inline"><em>n</em></span> where <span class="math inline"><em>a</em><em>n</em><sup>2</sup> &gt; <em>b</em><em>n</em></span>, for any values of <span class="math inline"><em>a</em></span> and <span class="math inline"><em>b</em></span>.</p>
<p>The same argument applies to the non-leading terms. Even if the run time of Algorithm A were <span class="math inline"><em>n</em> + 1000000</span>, it would still be better than Algorithm B for sufficiently large <span class="math inline"><em>n</em></span>.</p>
<p>In general, we expect an algorithm with a smaller leading term to be a better algorithm for large problems, but for smaller problems, there may be a <span><strong>crossover point</strong></span> where another algorithm is better. The location of the crossover point depends on the details of the algorithms, the inputs, and the hardware, so it is usually ignored for purposes of algorithmic analysis. But that doesn’t mean you can forget about it.</p>
<p>If two algorithms have the same leading order term, it is hard to say which is better; again, the answer depends on the details. So for algorithmic analysis, functions with the same leading term are considered equivalent, even if they have different coefficients.</p>
<p>An <span><strong>order of growth</strong></span> is a set of functions whose growth behavior is considered equivalent. For example, <span class="math inline">2<em>n</em></span>, <span class="math inline">100<em>n</em></span> and <span class="math inline"><em>n</em> + 1</span> belong to the same order of growth, which is written <span class="math inline"><em>O</em>(<em>n</em>)</span> in <span><strong>Big-Oh notation</strong></span> and often called <span><strong>linear</strong></span> because every function in the set grows linearly with <span class="math inline"><em>n</em></span>.</p>
<p>All functions with the leading term <span class="math inline"><em>n</em><sup>2</sup></span> belong to <span class="math inline"><em>O</em>(<em>n</em><sup>2</sup>)</span>; they are called <span><strong>quadratic</strong></span>.</p>
<p>The following table shows some of the orders of growth that appear most commonly in algorithmic analysis, in increasing order of badness.</p>

<p>For the logarithmic terms, the base of the logarithm doesn’t matter; changing bases is the equivalent of multiplying by a constant, which doesn’t change the order of growth. Similarly, all exponential functions belong to the same order of growth regardless of the base of the exponent. Exponential functions grow very quickly, so exponential algorithms are only useful for small problems.</p>

<p>Programmers who care about performance often find this kind of analysis hard to swallow. They have a point: sometimes the coefficients and the non-leading terms make a real difference. Sometimes the details of the hardware, the programming language, and the characteristics of the input make a big difference. And for small problems, order of growth is irrelevant.</p>
<p>But if you keep those caveats in mind, algorithmic analysis is a useful tool. At least for large problems, the “better” algorithm is usually better, and sometimes it is <span><em>much</em></span> better. The difference between two algorithms with the same order of growth is usually a constant factor, but the difference between a good algorithm and a bad algorithm is unbounded!</p>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>Analysis of basic Python operations</span></p>
<p>In Python, most arithmetic operations are constant time; multiplication usually takes longer than addition and subtraction, and division takes even longer, but these run times don’t depend on the magnitude of the operands. Very large integers are an exception; in that case the run time increases with the number of digits.</p>
<p>Indexing operations—reading or writing elements in a sequence or dictionary—are also constant time, regardless of the size of the data structure.</p>
<p>A <span><code>for</code></span> loop that traverses a sequence or dictionary is usually linear, as long as all of the operations in the body of the loop are constant time. For example, adding up the elements of a list is linear:</p>
<pre><code>    total = 0
    for x in t:
        total += x</code></pre>
<p>The built-in function <span><code>sum</code></span> is also linear because it does the same thing, but it tends to be faster because it is a more efficient implementation; in the language of algorithmic analysis, it has a smaller leading coefficient.</p>
<p>As a rule of thumb, if the body of a loop is in <span class="math inline"><em>O</em>(<em>n</em><sup><em>a</em></sup>)</span> then the whole loop is in <span class="math inline"><em>O</em>(<em>n</em><sup><em>a</em> + 1</sup>)</span>. The exception is if you can show that the loop exits after a constant number of iterations. If a loop runs <span class="math inline"><em>k</em></span> times regardless of <span class="math inline"><em>n</em></span>, then the loop is in <span class="math inline"><em>O</em>(<em>n</em><sup><em>a</em></sup>)</span>, even for large <span class="math inline"><em>k</em></span>.</p>
<p>Multiplying by <span class="math inline"><em>k</em></span> doesn’t change the order of growth, but neither does dividing. So if the body of a loop is in <span class="math inline"><em>O</em>(<em>n</em><sup><em>a</em></sup>)</span> and it runs <span class="math inline"><em>n</em>/<em>k</em></span> times, the loop is in <span class="math inline"><em>O</em>(<em>n</em><sup><em>a</em> + 1</sup>)</span>, even for large <span class="math inline"><em>k</em></span>.</p>
<p>Most string and tuple operations are linear, except indexing and <span><code> len</code></span>, which are constant time. The built-in functions <span><code>min</code></span> and <span><code>max</code></span> are linear. The run-time of a slice operation is proportional to the length of the output, but independent of the size of the input.</p>
<p>String concatenation is linear; the run time depends on the sum of the lengths of the operands.</p>
<p>All string methods are linear, but if the lengths of the strings are bounded by a constant—for example, operations on single characters—they are considered constant time. The string method <span><code>join</code></span> is linear; the run time depends on the total length of the strings.</p>
<p>Most list methods are linear, but there are some exceptions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Adding an element to the end of a list is constant time on average; when it runs out of room it occasionally gets copied to a bigger location, but the total time for <span class="math inline"><em>n</em></span> operations is <span class="math inline"><em>O</em>(<em>n</em>)</span>, so the average time for each operation is <span class="math inline"><em>O</em>(1)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Removing an element from the end of a list is constant time.</p></li>
<li><p>Sorting is <span class="math inline"><em>O</em>(<em>n</em>log <em>n</em>)</span>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Most dictionary operations and methods are constant time, but there are some exceptions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The run time of <span><code>update</code></span> is proportional to the size of the dictionary passed as a parameter, not the dictionary being updated.</p></li>
<li><p><span><code>keys</code></span>, <span><code>values</code></span> and <span><code>items</code></span> are constant time because they return iterators. But if you loop through the iterators, the loop will be linear.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>Analysis of search algorithms</span></p>
<p>A <span><strong>search</strong></span> is an algorithm that takes a collection and a target item and determines whether the target is in the collection, often returning the index of the target.</p>
<p>The simplest search algorithm is a “linear search”, which traverses the items of the collection in order, stopping if it finds the target. In the worst case it has to traverse the entire collection, so the run time is linear.</p>
<p>The <span><code>in</code></span> operator for sequences uses a linear search; so do string methods like <span><code>find</code></span> and <span><code>count</code></span>.</p>
<p>If the elements of the sequence are in order, you can use a <span> <strong>bisection search</strong></span>, which is <span class="math inline"><em>O</em>(log <em>n</em>)</span>. Bisection search is similar to the algorithm you might use to look a word up in a dictionary (a paper dictionary, not the data structure). Instead of starting at the beginning and checking each item in order, you start with the item in the middle and check whether the word you are looking for comes before or after. If it comes before, then you search the first half of the sequence. Otherwise you search the second half. Either way, you cut the number of remaining items in half.</p>
<p>If the sequence has 1,000,000 items, it will take about 20 steps to find the word or conclude that it’s not there. So that’s about 50,000 times faster than a linear search.</p>
<p>Bisection search can be much faster than linear search, but it requires the sequence to be in order, which might require extra work.</p>
<p>There is another data structure, called a <span><strong>hashtable</strong></span> that is even faster—it can do a search in constant time—and it doesn’t require the items to be sorted. Python dictionaries are implemented using hashtables, which is why most dictionary operations, including the <span><code>in</code></span> operator, are constant time.</p>
<p><span>section</span> <span>1</span> <span>0mm</span> <span>-3.5ex -1ex -.2ex</span> <span>0.7ex .2ex</span> <span><strong></strong></span><span>Hashtables</span> <span id="hashtable" label="hashtable">[hashtable]</span></p>
<p>To explain how hashtables work and why their performance is so good, I start with a simple implementation of a map and gradually improve it until it’s a hashtable.</p>
<p>I use Python to demonstrate these implementations, but in real life you wouldn’t write code like this in Python; you would just use a dictionary! So for the rest of this chapter, you have to imagine that dictionaries don’t exist and you want to implement a data structure that maps from keys to values. The operations you have to implement are:</p>
<dl>
<dt><span><code>add(k, v)</code></span>:</dt>
<dd><p>Add a new item that maps from key <span><code>k</code></span> to value <span><code>v</code></span>. With a Python dictionary, <span><code>d</code></span>, this operation is written <span><code>d[k] = v</code></span>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><span><code>get(k)</code></span>:</dt>
<dd><p>Look up and return the value that corresponds to key <span><code>k</code></span>. With a Python dictionary, <span><code>d</code></span>, this operation is written <span><code>d[k]</code></span> or <span><code>d.get(k)</code></span>.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>For now, I assume that each key only appears once. The simplest implementation of this interface uses a list of tuples, where each tuple is a key-value pair.</p>
<pre><code>class LinearMap:

    def __init__(self):
        self.items = []

    def add(self, k, v):
        self.items.append((k, v))

    def get(self, k):
        for key, val in self.items:
            if key == k:
                return val
        raise KeyError</code></pre>
<p><span><code>add</code></span> appends a key-value tuple to the list of items, which takes constant time.</p>
<p><span><code>get</code></span> uses a <span><code>for</code></span> loop to search the list: if it finds the target key it returns the corresponding value; otherwise it raises a <span><code>KeyError</code></span>. So <span><code>get</code></span> is linear.</p>
<p>An alternative is to keep the list sorted by key. Then <span><code>get</code></span> could use a bisection search, which is <span class="math inline"><em>O</em>(log <em>n</em>)</span>. But inserting a new item in the middle of a list is linear, so this might not be the best option. There are other data structures that can implement <span><code> add</code></span> and <span><code>get</code></span> in log time, but that’s still not as good as constant time, so let’s move on.</p>
<p>One way to improve <span><code>LinearMap</code></span> is to break the list of key-value pairs into smaller lists. Here’s an implementation called <span><code>BetterMap</code></span>, which is a list of 100 LinearMaps. As we’ll see in a second, the order of growth for <span><code>get</code></span> is still linear, but <span><code>BetterMap</code></span> is a step on the path toward hashtables:</p>
<pre><code>class BetterMap:

    def __init__(self, n=100):
        self.maps = []
        for i in range(n):
            self.maps.append(LinearMap())

    def find_map(self, k):
        index = hash(k) % len(self.maps)
        return self.maps[index]

    def add(self, k, v):
        m = self.find_map(k)
        m.add(k, v)

    def get(self, k):
        m = self.find_map(k)
        return m.get(k)</code></pre>
<p><code>__init__</code> makes a list of <span><code>n</code></span> <span><code>LinearMap</code></span>s.</p>
<p><code>find_map</code> is used by <span><code>add</code></span> and <span><code>get</code></span> to figure out which map to put the new item in, or which map to search.</p>
<p><code>find_map</code> uses the built-in function <span><code>hash</code></span>, which takes almost any Python object and returns an integer. A limitation of this implementation is that it only works with hashable keys. Mutable types like lists and dictionaries are unhashable.</p>
<p>Hashable objects that are considered equivalent return the same hash value, but the converse is not necessarily true: two objects with different values can return the same hash value.</p>
<p><code>find_map</code> uses the modulus operator to wrap the hash values into the range from 0 to <span><code>len(self.maps)</code></span>, so the result is a legal index into the list. Of course, this means that many different hash values will wrap onto the same index. But if the hash function spreads things out pretty evenly (which is what hash functions are designed to do), then we expect <span class="math inline"><em>n</em>/100</span> items per LinearMap.</p>
<p>Since the run time of <span><code>LinearMap.get</code></span> is proportional to the number of items, we expect BetterMap to be about 100 times faster than LinearMap. The order of growth is still linear, but the leading coefficient is smaller. That’s nice, but still not as good as a hashtable.</p>
<p>Here (finally) is the crucial idea that makes hashtables fast: if you can keep the maximum length of the LinearMaps bounded, <span><code> LinearMap.get</code></span> is constant time. All you have to do is keep track of the number of items and when the number of items per LinearMap exceeds a threshold, resize the hashtable by adding more LinearMaps.</p>
<p>Here is an implementation of a hashtable:</p>
<pre><code>class HashMap:

    def __init__(self):
        self.maps = BetterMap(2)
        self.num = 0

    def get(self, k):
        return self.maps.get(k)

    def add(self, k, v):
        if self.num == len(self.maps.maps):
            self.resize()

        self.maps.add(k, v)
        self.num += 1

    def resize(self):
        new_maps = BetterMap(self.num * 2)

        for m in self.maps.maps:
            for k, v in m.items:
                new_maps.add(k, v)

        self.maps = new_maps</code></pre>
<p><code>__init__</code> creates a <span><code>BetterMap</code></span> and initializes <span><code>num</code></span>, which keeps track of the number of items.</p>
<p><span><code>get</code></span> just dispatches to <span><code>BetterMap</code></span>. The real work happens in <span><code>add</code></span>, which checks the number of items and the size of the <span><code>BetterMap</code></span>: if they are equal, the average number of items per LinearMap is 1, so it calls <span><code>resize</code></span>.</p>
<p><span><code>resize</code></span> make a new <span><code>BetterMap</code></span>, twice as big as the previous one, and then “rehashes” the items from the old map to the new.</p>
<p>Rehashing is necessary because changing the number of LinearMaps changes the denominator of the modulus operator in <code>find_map</code>. That means that some objects that used to hash into the same LinearMap will get split up (which is what we wanted, right?).</p>
<p>Rehashing is linear, so <span><code>resize</code></span> is linear, which might seem bad, since I promised that <span><code>add</code></span> would be constant time. But remember that we don’t have to resize every time, so <span><code>add</code></span> is usually constant time and only occasionally linear. The total amount of work to run <span><code>add</code></span> <span class="math inline"><em>n</em></span> times is proportional to <span class="math inline"><em>n</em></span>, so the average time of each <span><code>add</code></span> is constant time!</p>
<p>To see how this works, think about starting with an empty HashTable and adding a sequence of items. We start with 2 LinearMaps, so the first 2 adds are fast (no resizing required). Let’s say that they take one unit of work each. The next add requires a resize, so we have to rehash the first two items (let’s call that 2 more units of work) and then add the third item (one more unit). Adding the next item costs 1 unit, so the total so far is 6 units of work for 4 items.</p>
<p>The next <span><code>add</code></span> costs 5 units, but the next three are only one unit each, so the total is 14 units for the first 8 adds.</p>
<p>The next <span><code>add</code></span> costs 9 units, but then we can add 7 more before the next resize, so the total is 30 units for the first 16 adds.</p>
<p>After 32 adds, the total cost is 62 units, and I hope you are starting to see a pattern. After <span class="math inline"><em>n</em></span> adds, where <span class="math inline"><em>n</em></span> is a power of two, the total cost is <span class="math inline">2<em>n</em> − 2</span> units, so the average work per add is a little less than 2 units. When <span class="math inline"><em>n</em></span> is a power of two, that’s the best case; for other values of <span class="math inline"><em>n</em></span> the average work is a little higher, but that’s not important. The important thing is that it is <span class="math inline"><em>O</em>(1)</span>.</p>
<p>Figure <a href="#fig.hash" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig.hash">[fig.hash]</a> shows how this works graphically. Each block represents a unit of work. The columns show the total work for each add in order from left to right: the first two <span><code>adds</code></span> cost 1 unit each, the third costs 3 units, etc.</p>

</figure>
<p>The extra work of rehashing appears as a sequence of increasingly tall towers with increasing space between them. Now if you knock over the towers, spreading the cost of resizing over all adds, you can see graphically that the total cost after <span class="math inline"><em>n</em></span> adds is <span class="math inline">2<em>n</em> − 2</span>.</p>
<p>An important feature of this algorithm is that when we resize the HashTable it grows geometrically; that is, we multiply the size by a constant. If you increase the size arithmetically—adding a fixed number each time—the average time per <span><code>add</code></span> is linear.</p>
<p>You can download my implementation of HashMap from <a href="http://thinkpython2.com/code/Map.py">http://thinkpython2.com/code/Map.py</a>, but remember that there is no reason to use it; if you want a map, just use a Python dictionary.</p>

Its performance is good enough for the vast majority of applications, but if it turned out that my application was too slow, I would use a profiler to see where the time was being spent. If it looked like a faster sort algorithm would have a significant effect on performance, then I would look around for a good implementation of radix sort.”<a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
